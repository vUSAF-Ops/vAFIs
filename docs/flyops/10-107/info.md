2. **Mission Report approval / denial authority established:**
   1. **Air Staff:** Any air staff member may approve or deny any filed Mission Report (MISREP) file by any member of the organization. The Deputy Chief of Staff or his designee shall be responsible for the review, approval / denial of air staff mission reports.

MAJCOM/CC shall also be the first level of review for requests for MISREP denials received from within their command. The MAJCOM/CC shall review such request in accordance with this document.
   4. **Numbered Air Force Commander (NAF/CC) / MAJCOM Support Staff:** NAF/CC and MAJCOM Support staff at the pleasure of the MAJCOM/CC shall reserve the authority to approve / deny mission reports filed by members within their chain of command. In instances whereby a MAJCOM has more than one numbered air force, the MAJCOM/CC reserves the authority to limit the NAF/CC authority of mission report approval / denial to units within that NAF/CC jurisdiction.
   5. **Wing Commander (WG/CC):** Wing commander and his support staff shall be responsible for mission reports filed by the squadron commander and any squadron support staff within their wing. In the event of a mission report is inappropriate by their own review or by their subordinate staff, the WG/CC shall forward such denial requests to their MAJCOM/CC for review.
   6. **Squadron Commander (SQ/CC):** Squadron commander and his support staff shall be responsible for mission reports filed by the squadron commander and any squadron support staff within their wing. In the event of a mission report is inappropriate by their own review or by their subordinate staff, the SQ/CC shall forward such denial requests to their Wing/CC for review.

3. **Mission Report Approval:**
   1. The personnel issuing a mission assignment to unit members shall be responsible for ensuring that the mission assignment is completed in accordance to vUSAF policy, and review and approve / deny the associated mission report for the assignment.
   2. In the event that a member of the chain of command is inactive or is on approved leave, the next higher chain of command shall retain authority to ensure that mission reports are reviewed and approved in a timely manner.
   3. No member of the vUSAF shall approve their own mission report for any reason, any report approved found to be filed and approved in this manner shall be subject for removal and the credit removed and the person subject to disciplinary action.
   4. Approval Chain of Command Defined:
      1. Air staff reports, shall be approved by the VUSAF/DCS or his designee.
      2. MAJCOM Commanders reports shall be approved by the office of A3 or higher.
      3. MAJCOM Support staff / NAF CC reports shall be approved by the MAJCOM/CC or higher.

      7. Squadron support staff reports shall be approved by the squadron commander or higher.
      8. Unit members reports shall be approved by their appropriate chain of command.

4. **Mission report denial procedure:**
   1. In the event that a squadron or wing staff have determined that a mission report is inappropriate, they shall immediately generate a written report as to the facts used to determine why the mission report should be denied. The written statement, shall include, the name of the member whom the report was filed by, the flight report number, and the content of the report.
   2. Squadron / wing staff shall also generate a email advising the member in question that their mission report is being referred for possible denial and then indicate the reason(s) why the report is being reviewed. This notification shall be copied to the member\'s entire chain of command ending with the office of A3.
   3. The report shall be reviewed by the Director of Air and Space Operations (A3). The office of A3 may defer the review to the MAJCOM Commander that the report originates. In the event that the review is deferred to the MAJCOM/CC, the MAJCOM/CC shall then generate a written statement indicating their corrective action taken to resolve the issue. The office of A3 will then send a request ticket to the Director of personnel if any adjustments to a logbook is required and a report removed.
   4. This section does not preclude common sense to remedy incidental mission report errors that may require correction and the only recourse is the deletion of a report and a correction to a form 201 file. In that event, notification to the member\'s CoC to have the Director of Personnel make the adjustment shall suffice.

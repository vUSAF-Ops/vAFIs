**PURPOSE:** To standardize callsigns and reduce confusion while aiding pilots, support staff, and ATC personnel in the identification of and communication with vUSAF assets.

1. **Definitions.**
   1. **Standard Aircraft Callsign.**
      1. Callsign entry is limited to 7 characters.
      2. Callsign begins with a letter code from the list below followed by the last 4 digits of the pilots vUSAF ID Number. For example, pilot with pilot ID USAF2001 will use the callsign A2001.
         > A -- Air Force and Air Force Reserve
         >
         > G -- Air National Guard
      3. Instructor pilots who are online and available to assist student pilots are expected to append the letter "I" to the end of their Standard Aircraft Callsign.
   2. **Tactical Aircraft Callsign.**
      1. A four or five-letter word followed by one or two numbers. ***No tactical callsign may exceed seven characters.***
      2. Tactical callsign words may be truncated, abbreviated, or phonetically spelled words. Tactical callsigns will be entered as spoken. Non-truncated example: \"SLIP13 \". Truncated example: \"SENTRY 05\" will be entered as \"SNTRY05\" on a flight plan.
      3. Standard Tactical Callsign is a squadron-specific tactical callsign.
      4. Non-Standard Tactical Callsign is a tactical callsign not assigned to a specific squadron normally reserved for special operations or events.
      5. Special Use Callsigns are non-squadron specific tactical callsigns used to designate specific types of flights. *The following are [approved]{.underline} **Special Use Callsigns**:*
         > RCH -- **all** AMC Cargo flights
         >
         > SAM -- **all** AMC Personnel flights
         >
         > SHELL or TEXACO -- Tanker flights providing refueling tasking within CONUS

2. **Usage:**
   1. ***Proper use of vUSAF callsigns is a condition of membership.*** A Standard callsign is the default callsign approved for online flights on VASTIM. Tactical callsigns shall only be used when assigned or on approved training or tactical missions. Commanders shall designate callsigns when assigning missions.
      1. **Standard vUSAF Callsign.** The Standard Aircraft Callsign shall be used for all online multi-player flights except where a Tactical Callsign has been specifically assigned or approved.
      2. **Standard Tactical Callsign.** A Standard Tactical Callsign shall only be used within the approved squadron. Normally, an assigned Standard Tactical Callsign will be part of a Mission Assignment narrative.
      3. **Non-Standard Tactical Callsign.** A Non-Standard Tactical Callsign shall only be used when assigned and approved by either the Squadron Commander or his designee. Normally, Non-Standard Tactical Callsigns will only be used for special operations or specific events which require different callsigns.
      4. **Special Use Callsigns.** These callsigns shall be used on Mission Assignments that are outside the normal mission assignment of a squadron. The appropriate Special Use Callsign will be issued as the part of the Mission Briefing and Air Tasking Order.

3. **Assignment.**
   1. **Default.** The Standard vUSAF Callsign shall be the default for any flight for which another callsign has not been assigned or coordinated.
   2. **Squadron Assignment.** At the option of the Squadron Commander and with approval by the MAJCOM Commander, use of a Standard Tactical Callsign may be authorized for online multi-player training exercises in which more than one aircraft participates. Where a squadron has more than one Standard Tactical Callsign, only one may be designated as the default. Squadron Commanders must request approval for use of Standard Tactical Callsigns prior to their use. Squadron default callsigns do not preempt callsigns assigned for a specific Mission Assignment.
   3. **Number Assignment.** Assignment of a callsign flight number is left to the discretion of the assigning officer. At the option of the Squadron Commander, a squadron flight numbering plan may be implemented which could include default numbers for each squadron pilot. If any numbering plan is used, a copy shall be available to all squadron pilots and approved by the Wing Commander. Normally, aircraft in a flight will use numbers in sequence with the flight lead having the lowest number. Default numbers do not preempt numbers assigned for a specific Mission Assignment. If no number is assigned, the pilot will use the last two numbers of their ID.

**PURPOSE:**

This instruction prescribes basic policy and guidance for training and currency requirements of the Virtual United States Air Force (vUSAF).

1. **General.** This instruction prescribes basic policy and guidance for training of Virtual United States Air Force (vUSAF) and gained pilots. Undergraduate and Mission pilot production is tasked to the Air Education and Training Command (AETC). Undergraduate and Mission Qualification Training (MQT) is conducted according to AETC instructions and approved syllabi. The pilot's assigned unit conducts continuation training.

    1. **Program Goals.** The vUSAF Pilot Training Program (PTP) ensures all new members obtain and maintain the qualification and proficiency needed to effectively perform their unit's mission. Programs should strive to minimize the amount of retraining necessary when flying personnel return to duties for an aircraft in which they were previously qualified. The overall objective of the aircrew training program is to develop and maintain a high state of mission readiness for immediate and effective employment across the range of military operations.

    2. **Waiver Authority.** Unless otherwise specified in this instruction vUSAF/A3 or higher is the waiver authority for this instruction. Request waivers to the basic guidance in this instruction through applicable training channels to the MAJCOM or equivalent level. MAJCOM Commanders will forward requests in message or memo format to vUSAF/A3 and copy the vUSAF/CoS and vUSAF/VCoS.

    3. **Responsibilities:**

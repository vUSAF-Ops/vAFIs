    2. **Supported simulation platform:** Is defined as the current platform that the *Virtual United States Air Force* considers as its primary platform and supports with free ware scenery and other products from the membership and the virtual community.

    3. **Secondary simulation software platforms:** Any additional simulation platform that **WAS NOT** selected by a member at the time of enlistment that is listed in section 2.3 of this instruction.

    4. **Support Software:** Any program or software that by design is not a simulator however is used to improve the use of a primary or secondary simulation platform. Such programs to be considered as a part of this definition would be such programs as scenery creation, airframe creation, instrument creation, and etc. that create various files or programs to be used by a primary or secondary simulation platform.

    1. Digital Combat Simulator - DCS World Series

5. **LIMITED AUTHORIZED USE OF SECONDARY SIMULATION PLATFORMS**

6. **SELECTION OF SIMULATION PLATFORMS**

    Primary and secondary simulation platforms are determined at the time of enlistment by new members.

    The platform selected at the time of enlistment shall be considered the PRIMARY simulation platform. Any member may utilize a secondary platform and receive credit for that use so long as it does not exceed 50% of their total monthly activity AND the member has met their currency requirements in their primary platform and logged at least 50% of their required monthly activity in their primary platform.

    Members who are delinquent in their obligations for their primary platform shall not receive credit for hours or work on a secondary platform during the period of said delinquency.

7. **APPROVAL REQUIRED**

The vUSAF/CS shall reserve the right to revoke the use of secondary platforms at any time.

8. **FLIGHT TIME CREDIT**

Members are eligible to obtain flight time credit on their Form 201 file in an authorized secondary simulation platform if the platform is being used for training operations. vUSAF members and command staff are only permitted to log a maximum of 50% of their monthly activity obligation to the vUSAF with a secondary platform. It is the responsibility of the commanding officer that is reviewing MISREPs to enforce this policy.

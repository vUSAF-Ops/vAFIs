**PURPOSE:** To standardize the procedures and operations of tactical forces engaged in air-to air and air-to-ground operations within Special Use Airspace on the VATSIM Network.

1. **General.** This instruction prescribes basic policy and guidance for rule of engagement (ROEs) during exercises and operations for vUSAF pilots. Pilots are encouraged to use these ROEs in day-to-day training missions.

    1. **Airspace and Navigation**

        1. All Air-to-Air and Air-to-Ground attacks must occur in a MOA, RESTRICTED, OR SUA. Tactical Operations are allowed within Special Use Airspace without a controller.

        2. No Tactical Operations are allowed outside of Special Use Airspace at any time.

        3. If during operations, civil aircraft fly through the area, whoever sees the intruder will call \"Terminate\". If Range Control is up, they will try to contact the pilot and advise them of the hazards and provide advisories to participating aircraft. If Range Control is not available all operations will stop until the traffic is cleared of the SUA, then operations may resume.

        4. There are no speed restrictions in the Special Use Airspace other than realistic aircraft capabilities, unless stated otherwise. Altitudes are surface to FL600 unless otherwise stated. VFR flight plan will be used in the MOA.

        5. Aircraft are required to immediately cease tactical flying and navigate normally when departing Special Use Airspace. If required by LOA or LOP, aircraft are to enter and exit Special Use Airspace through the defined fixes.

    2. **Weapon Employment**

        1. All combat pilots are encouraged to use Tacpack and run snapper to capture action photos for scoring purposes

        2. Damages inflicted by the Tacpack, are the only type valid without a screenshot.

        3. Aircraft only carry ordinance as set via the Tacpack system if utilizing Tacpack.

        4. Weapons 4 by Chris Sykes is authorized, Screenshots are mandatory.

        5. Fighter aircraft will not attack unarmed SAR or humanitarian helicopters/VTOL aircraft unless stated otherwise in the Mission Briefing. Combat aircraft may engage combat rotary/VTOL aircraft within the theater of operations upon verification that said aircraft are armed and clearly engaged in aggressive combat operations within the theater of operation, engagements will be governed by section 1.2 of this document.

        6. In order to be recorded by Tacpack system -- Gun shots must occur within .4 NM of the target and the target must remain inside a circle of 1.5deg, centered on the water line of the HUD. Damage to the aircraft is randomly determined when there is a valid kill shot.

        7. Non Tacpack combat aircraft must submit a screenshot for validation to Warlord.

        8. Short range missiles are allowed and controlled via the Tacpack

        9. Medium Range Missiles are allowed and controlled via the Tacpack

    3. **Aircraft Kill\'s:**

        1. Damage is dependent on system used.

        2. Aircraft badly damaged or destroyed will use the SAR force per the following

            1. As the primary means regeneration. If no SAR forces are available, the pilot may elect to follow paragraphs 1.3.2.2 or 1.3.2.3.

            2. Glide or eject to ground/water and await recovery by SAR forces. Downed Aircrew should wait until receiving an estimate recovery time. Once picked-up, pilots should log off VATSIM and return to base to regenerate and re-arm. Pilots must wait for the SAR forces to return them to their base before launching again.

            3. Exit exercise airspace and return to base to re-generate and re- arm there is a **15-minute waiting period** set by the event planner for rearming unless stated otherwise. This will be set in VRS Tacpack Manger.

            4. Immediately log off VATSIM and restart back at base. There is a 15-minute waiting time, set by the event planner, before the pilot is regenerated and can take off again, unless stated otherwise.

        3. If a previously non-fully damaged aircraft returns to base (RTB) for fuel or any other reason, that aircraft is considered regenerated and at 100%. Re-arming and refueling time will be a 5-minute waiting period.

        4. Multiple aircraft-on-aircraft engagements are permitted unless stated otherwise. Section 1.2 weapons employment shall apply to multiple engagements.

    4. **Surface-to-Air Missiles:**

        1. Surface to Air Missiles (SAMs) may be launched in Multiplayer only from the Restricted or Warning Areas when authorized.

        2. SAMs are only allowed to launch and fly when tracking participating enemy aircraft within 20nm.

        3. Aircraft hit with by SAM will suffer random failure.

        4. AAA / SAM\'s RADAR can be hit and disabled by Air-Ground ordnance. If a AAA / SAM's RADAR site takes a hit, that particular ADS location cannot be used until re- supplied by air cargo operations.

    5. **Air to Ground**

        1. Aircraft may use any appropriate ordinance for air to ground or sea attacks.

        2. Ordinance must result in visible explosions and verified by the Tacpack log or recorded in the FSX@war database, or by screenshot.

        3. Screen shots may be taken from any view that allows the strike to be verified.

    6. **Flight Simulator Settings**

        1. Detect crash and damage ON, (OFF for Tacpack users. Tacpack utilizes its own settings that override P3d/FSX)

        2. Allow collision with other aircraft OFF

        3. Unlimited fuel -- OFF

        4. G-effects -- ON

        5. Sun Glare - ON.

        6. All flight model sliders -- MAX

        7. ATC -- Aircraft labels -- OFF

        8. RADAR must be in forward looking mode versus 360-degree mode.

    7. **Communications**

        1. The following communication equipment is required for all players:

            1. Discord

        2. All ATC and pilots will set their radios as follows:

            1. ATC VATSIM radio will be used for Range Control/Tactical frequency (if present).

            2. Discord will be used as the Tactical Frequency if Range Control is not present.

            3. Text will be set to Range Control Frequency that is the same for all players.

            4. When using the \"Knock-it-Off\" or \"Terminate\" calls, all aircraft involved will reply with their call sign and the term being used. Example: BOAR01 calls knock-it- off, the other aircraft would respond: BOAR02 \"Knock-it-off\", BANDT14 \"Knock-it-off\", etc. Pilots will **IMMEDIATELY** disengage targets, climb to their predefined safe altitudes and hold at their predesignated hold points. Pilots may use that time to either RTB or AAR at the WARLORD's discretion.

    8. **Multiplayer Clients.**

        1. Vpilot is authorized for Vatsim connection

        2. Fsinn is authorized for Vatsim connection

        3. Join FS to be used for multiplayer ops.

        4. FSInn settimgs -- Disable multiplayer

        5. vPilot- Display aircraft =0, display range = 0

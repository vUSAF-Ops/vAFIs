    2. Fighters in advanced training must notify AFPC with training completion. Update and awards will be assigned by AFPC.

12. **MISREP Reporting:** Instructor Pilots shall properly complete a MISREP for [each]{.underline} instructional activity (ground instruction, testing and evaluation, or instructional flight) performed as an Instructor Pilot. Instructor Pilots shall select "FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR" as the mission profile to properly report the flight and receive credit as outlined, in Section 3.1. The Instructor Pilot shall include the name and VUSAF ID of the Student Pilot, instruction covered, results, and endorsements made after the training session. Failure to record this basic information may result in [no flight]{.underline} credit for either, or both, the Instructor Pilot and the Student Pilot.

13. **Revocation of Privileges:** Failure to comply with the provisions of this Instruction may result in the revocation of Instructor Pilot privileges. Any member may request that an Instructor Pilot be examined, or have his performance evaluated as an Instructor Pilot.

Concerns regarding any Instructor Pilot's compliance with the provisions of this Instruction or performance of his duties as an Instructor Pilot should be directed to AF/A3, AF/DC, or AF/CS. Only one of these officers can determine when a duly rated member is no longer able to perform the duties of an Instructor Pilot, and recommend to AF/A1 the suspension or revocation of an Instructor Pilot rating.

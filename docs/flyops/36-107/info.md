**PURPOSE:** The purpose of this document is to establish policy regarding Airframe assignment and the limitations thereof, for all VUSAF members.

1. **Definitions.** Refer to Attachment 1.

2. **Airframe Assignment.**

    1. **Primary Airframe.** With the exception of those assigned to AETC, each VUSAF pilot shall be assigned to one (1) Primary Airframe, which they are authorized to log flight time in, and are required to earn a rating for. Members not assigned to a VUSAF pilot role, such as Air Traffic Controllers, may be assigned a Primary Airframe, with the approval of AF/A3.

        1. Initial assignment will be made by VUSAF staff during the initial flight screening process, and will be based upon the applicant's requested Airframe selection(s), previous online flight experience, and the operational needs of the organization. Members desiring assignment to another Airframe must refer to the applicable sections of this instruction and the VUSAF Transfer Policy outlined in vAFI36-104.

        2. Primary Airframe assignment shall be denoted in the member's 201 File and managed by AFPC. Requests for updates to this field must be made through AFPC.

        3. It is the responsibility of each member to maintain currency in their Primary Airframe in accordance with the policy outlined in vAFI11-202.

    2. **Additional Airframe.** A member of the VUSAF may hold multiple advanced ratings and may be assigned an Additional Airframe.

        1. **Requirements.** A member may request assignment to, and a rating for, an Additional Airframe.

            1. Members must have the approval of their Wing Commander before beginning training for a rating in an Additional Airframe.

            2. Members must have completed MQT in their Primary Airframe, hold a MR rating, and maintain currency in their Primary Airframe in order to be approved for Additional Airframe assignments and ratings.

            3. Members with Additional Airframe assignments and ratings may participate in VUSAF exercises, events, and operations provided they are Mission Ready rated and they maintain proficiency required in all rated airframes.

            4. Members in the grade of vCaptain and above may request one Additional Airframe training and rating, resulting in qualification in two airframes. Members in the grade of vMajor and above may be rated in a maximum of three airframes, unless serving as a Wing Commander, MAJCOM Staff, Air Staff, or pilot assigned to the 89^th^ AW.

            5. Members will be limited to Additional Airframes that are utilized within their command.

        2. **Staff Members.** Air Staff Members may hold an multiple airframe assignments on all aircraft operated by the VUSAF. MAJCOM Staff may hold multiple airframe assignments on any aircraft within their command. Staff Members may only participate in VUSAF events, exercises, and operations in an airframe for which they have earned a Mission Ready rating for and maintain currency in.

        3. **Additional - Logair Operations.** These units afford VUSAF members, particularly those who are not assigned to Composite or Objective Wings with multiple airframes, an opportunity to fly other Airframe and earn extra curricular flight hours.

            1. The only authorized Wings for Additional -- Logair Operations are:

                - 89^th^ Airlift Wing

            2. Members may earn hours through these units only with their Commander's specific authorization, and after they have earned Mission Ready qualification in their Primary Airframe.

            3. Members failing to maintain currency in their Primary Airframe shall not be permitted to log flight time and file a MISREP in Logair Airframes / Wings.

            4. There are no advanced ratings or Mission Ready (MR) requirements to be met by Members to log flight time and file a MISREP in Airframe assigned to Logair units.

            5. It is the responsibility of all Squadron and Wing Commanders to ensure that each pilot under their command is properly qualified to log Additional -- Logair Operations, as applicable.

3. **Privileges & Limitations.**

    1. Members are authorized to log flight and file MISREPs in their Primary and Additional Airframe provided:

        1. they have earned the appropriate advanced rating,

        2. they have received tasking or authorization from their Commanding Officer to make the flight, and

        3. they are current in the Airframe to be flown.

    2. Members are only authorized to participate in VUSAF Events, Exercises, and Operations in Airframe for which they have earned an advanced rating and are current in that rating.

    3. Instructor Pilots are authorized to operate and log flight in accordance with the policy and guidance of vAFI 36-106.

4. **Transfers.**

    1. Transferring member's airframe rating(s) and qualifications shall only transfer from one unit to another when the receiving unit is assigned the same airframe(s).

        1. In instances where a member transfers to a MAJCOM/Unit with dissimilar airframes, previous qualifications will only be noted in the Member's 201 file and the Member shall forfeit their currency and Mission Ready status for the airframe(s) that the member will no longer operate.

        2. In instances where a Member forfeits their currency and Mission Ready status, the member will be allowed to retain their BAQ.

            Example: A *Member transfers to ACC to fly F15s from AMC flying the C17. Due to the MAJCOM change from AMC to ACC, the member would receive an annotation in their 201 file for BAQ in the C17 and lose their MR status in the C17.*

    2. Transfers are managed in accordance with the policy outlined in vAFI 36-104.

5. **Currency.**

    1. Each Member shall maintain currency in their Primary Airframe, and Additional Airframe if applicable, in accordance with the policy outlined in vAFI 11-202.

    2. If a Member fails to maintain currency in their Primary Airframe, flight privileges and advanced ratings in the Additional Airframe will be suspended until MR status in the Primary Airframe is regained.

        1. During any suspension period, the Member will not be permitted to fly or log time in any Additional Airframe.

        2. If a member fails to maintain MR status in their Primary Airframe, regardless of their currency in other Airframe, the member shall be subject to the VUSAF inactivity policies and subject to removal from the organization.

    3. If a Member fails to maintain currency in their Additional Airframe, flight privileges and advanced ratings in the Additional Airframe will be suspended until MR status in the Additional Airframe is regained.

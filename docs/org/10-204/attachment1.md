## Terms

ACC (air component commander) -- The commander of a Joint Task Force's (JTF) air components; the air operational commander.

ARCP (air refueling control point) -- The planned geographic point over which the receivers arrive in the observation or precontact position with respect to the assigned tanker.

ARCT (air refueling control time) -- The planned time that the receiver and tanker will arrive over the ARCP.

ARIP (air refueling initial point) -- The planned point to enter the refueling track.

Armament safety check -- Action taken by an aircrew to review armament selection switches to preclude the inadvertent launch or release of armament (switches safe).

ATO (air tasking order) -- Assigns A/A and A/S targets, time on target (TOT), and mission support information.

Autonomous -- Aircrew is operating without command and control

BZ (buffer zone) -- Airspace of defined dimension and adjacent to or near borders which may have special restrictions.

C-Day -- Day on which the deployment operations begin.

CAP (combat air patrol) -- Refers to either a specific phase of an A/A mission or the geographic location of the fighter's surveillance orbit during an A/A mission prior to committing against a threat.

CAP Limit Line (CLL) -- Typically is line indicating the most forward position of friendly forces

Cell -- Two or more tankers flying in formation

D-Day -- Day on which a particular operation begins.

Dynamic targeting -- The process for prosecuting targets that are not detected, identified, or developed in time to be included in the planned targeting process, and therefore have not had actions scheduled against them in the ATO. Dynamic targets are further divided into two categories: Time-Sensitive Targets (TSTs), and Component Priority Targets (CPTs).

H-Hour -- Specific hour on D-Day an operation begins.

L-Hour -- Specific hour on C-Day a deployment begins.

Large Force Employment (LFE) -

M-Day -- Day on which mobilization operation begins.

Marshall Limit Line (MLL) -- Is a line that is established behind the CLL in order for assets to join up prior to push.

Planner -- Trusted agent who introduces planned scenario events during exercises.

Planner Staff -- Collective designation for planners.

Planned targeting -- The process for prosecuting targets that are detected, identified, and developed in sufficient time to schedule actions against them. Examples range from targets on Joint Integrated Prioritized Target List (JIPTL) in the applicable campaign plan, to targets detected in sufficient time to list in the ATO, mission-type orders, or fire support plans.

Players -- All exercise participants other than planners.

Rule of engagement (ROE) -- The ROEs contain the criteria and guidelines for weapons employment against an enemy. ROEs provide direction to the shooter governing what level of identification confidence is required to shoot. ROEs also include, but are not limited to, definitions of weapons control states (hold, tight, and free) and self-defense criteria

# Attachment 5 -- Air Tasking Order Example

1. ATO (AIR TASKING ORDER)

- Drafting an ATO requires some basic knowledge in order to organize the entire fleet. Producing an ATO can take some time to master and attention to detail and patience are a must.

- For the most part an ATO will look like the extract from Operation NORTHERN VIKING below. Three examples had been provided to better understand three different mission categories CSAR Alert, SEAD and Air refueling.

- We will now break the format down to obtain an in depth understanding.

- The ATO will always have the same format and it will be just a matter of assigning the aircraft to a time line, a target, and an objective.

- Items highlighted below are always standard and each mission line will have the same format to an extent. The only one that will be slightly different will be the refueling line which we will cover separately.

- Let's briefly look at some basic definitions and acronyms to better understand the ATO building process.

## Definitions

VUL TIME -- A period of time where missions are expected to be executed and/or ranges are active. Normally 3-4 hours per VUL time. The most challenging thing here is trying to find a good time to accommodate the bulk of participants; consider using polls at the forum to get an idea of when participants are going to be available.

FRAGGED -- Synonym to scheduled or programmed.

FTO -- Fighter Turn On, type of rendezvous used by fighters to join up with a tanker.

PPCP -- Point parallel rendezvous at the ARCP used by aircraft to join up with a tanker.

AREA HOLD -- Is a fix, NAVAID or geographical points where participants will meet / muster inside the range prior to a push time. An altitude deconfliction plan should also be developed with a minimum of 1000 foot vertical stack between flights to maintain safety.

MSN -- Primary Mission. (See Attachment 2 for full definitions) Some mission type categories are:

> AD -- Air Drop
>
> AR -- Air Refueling
>
> C2 -- Command and Control
>
> CAS -- Close Air Support
>
> CSAR -- Combat Search and Rescue
>
> DCA -- Defensive Counter Air
>
> ESC -- Escort
>
> HAAR -- Helicopter Air Refueling
>
> OCA -- Offensive Counter Air
>
> RA -- Red Air
>
> REC -- Reconnaissance
>
> SA -- Strategic Attack
>
> SEAD -- Suppression of Enemy Air defenses
>
> STK -- Strike

ALT -- Altitude

AR Track -- Air Refueling Track

2ND MSN -- Secondary Mission

ALT -- Altitude

ARCT -- Air Refueling Contact Time, is the time where the receiver and tanker join up.

<span style="color:blue">UNIT//MSN ID//BASE//#OF ACFT//CALLSIGN//MSN TIMES</span> *(Participating units)*

- UNIT – Tasked unit, Ex. 158FW
- MSN ID – Mission Number ID
  - We assign numbers that we can use for transponder codes later on
  - Example: MSN 0012 which can be a flight of four can squawk 0012-0015
- BASE – Departing airbase ICAO code. Ex BIKF
- No. OF ACFT – Number of aircraft and type (in order to avoid confusion, it is important to add correct type F15C vs. F15E) Ex. 4XF16C
- CALLSIGN – Self explanatory
- MSN TIMES – Time window when aircraft is expected to operate in. The first 30 min prior to launch is for mass mission briefing and last 30 min after landing for mass debriefing.

<span style="color:blue">AREA HOLD//PUSH TIME//MSN//ALT//AR TRACK//2ND MSN//ALT</span> *(Primary Mission Information)*

- AREA HOLD – A fix, NAVAID or coordinate should be selected for flights to meet or join up prior to a push.
- PUSH TIME – Just like the name implies it will be the time a particular flight will depart the area hold and proceed down range to conduct its mission(s).
- MSN- Mission category or type.
- ALT- Altitude.
  - Also develop a good altitude block plan for the push. For instance, keeping in mind airspace vertical limits, stack OCA high, strikers at medium/low altitude, etc.
- AR TRACK – AR track where aircraft is fragged to conduct air refueling.
- 2ND MSN –Secondary mission. For example, an F-15E might be fragged to conduct a SEAD mission as primary and secondary will be to escort bombers to a target area or vice versa.
- ALT- Altitude. Because it may be a different area leaving the aircraft at the same altitude can create safety issues with other aircraft operating in different areas.

Now let's go back to our examples and decode the following mission; for the most part there should be four lines, see below.

### Example #1

<span style="color:blue">2-AREA HOLD//PUSH TIME//MSN//ALT//AR TRACK//2ND MSN//ALT</span>

<span style="color:blue">3-AR TRACK//ARCT//AR ALT//RENDEZVOUS//ONLOAD/OFFLOAD//CALLSIGN</span>

<span style="color:blue">4-OTHER MSN INFO</span>

102 ERQS//M0001//BIKF//1XHC130//KING99/2330-0400Z

BID10//AS REQ//CSAR//050//N/A//N/A//N/A

ALERT AT BIKF FOR OPERATIONS IN BID10 FROM 0001Z TO 0400Z

Looking at the first line we obtain the following information;

- Tasked unit is the 102 ERQS

- Mission number is M0001 and squawk is 0001.

- Departing from BIKF, Keflavik NAS, Iceland

- Aircraft Type is one HC-130

- Callsign is KING99

- VUL time it will be covering 2330Z-0400Z

Let's see what can be obtained from line #2

- Area hold will be BID10

- The aircraft will push as required since it is a CSAR asset.

- Mission category is Combat Search and Rescue

- Altitude block will be 5000 feet

- The rest is not applicable to this aircraft's mission at this time.

From line three we obtain the following information;

- None, since it is not applicable

The last line is the OTHER INFO MSN INFO section and from it we can obtain the following information;

ALERT AT BIKF FOR OPERATIONS IN BID10 FROM 0001Z TO 0400Z

There you go, we have decoded our first ATO mission.

### Example #2

<span style="color:blue">1-UNIT//MSN ID//BASE//#OF ACFT//CALLSIGN//MSN TIMES</span>

<span style="color:blue">2-AREA HOLD//PUSH TIME//MSN//ALT//AR TRACK//2ND MSN//ALT</span>

<span style="color:blue">3-AR TRACK//ARCT//AR ALT//RENDEZVOUS//ONLOAD/OFFLOAD//CALLSIGN</span>

<span style="color:blue">4-OTHER MSN INFO</span>

AR2//0115Z//240//FTO//5K//EURO41

TGT: 10-1 THRU 10-5//INFO IN LFE SPINS

Looking at the first line we obtain the following information;

- Tasked unit is the 366 EFS

- Mission number is M0010 and squawk is 0010-0011.

- Departing from BIKF, Keflavik NAS, Iceland

- Aircraft Type are two F-15E's

- Callsign is WEASL 11 and 12

- VUL time it will be covering 2330Z-0400Z

Let's see what can be obtained from line #2

- Area hold will be the THORI intersection within BID10.

- The aircraft will push at 0045Z.

- Mission category is SEAD.

- Altitude block will be FL200

- Mission is fragged for refueling on AR Anchor AR2

- Secondary mission is SA and its altitude block FL220.

From line three we obtain the following information;

- Aircraft will conduct Air refueling in AR2 AR Anchor as previously stated

- ARCT is 0115Z

- Altitude FL240

- Rendezvous type is Fighter Turn On

- Onload will be 5,000 pounds.

- Tanker will be EURO41

The last line is the OTHER INFO MSN INFO section and from it we can obtain the following information;

- TGT: 10-1 THRU 10-5//INFO IN LFE SPINS

Looks like Weasel 11 flight is going after some targets and for that information we have to consult the LFE Spins document which will have coordinates and description of the target.

There you go! We have decoded our second ATO mission.

### Example #3

<span style="color:blue">1-UNIT//MSN ID//BASE//#OF ACFT//CALLSIGN//MSN TIMES</span>

<span style="color:blue">2-AREA HOLD//PUSH TIME//MSN//ALT//AR TRACK//2ND MSN//ALT</span>

<span style="color:blue">3-AR TRACK//ARCT//AR ALT//RENDEZVOUS//ONLOAD/OFFLOAD//CALLSIGN</span>

<span style="color:blue">4-OTHER MSN INFO</span>

384 EARS//MOO20//BIKF//1XKC135//EURO41//2330-0400Z

AR2//0045Z//AR//240//AR2//NA//NA

AR2//0115Z//240//FTO//10K//WEASL11-12

AR2//0200Z//240//FTO//20K//TREK31-32

AR2//0215Z//240//FTO//40K//CRUD01-02

Looking at the first line we obtain the following information;

- Tasked unit is the 384 EARS

- Mission number is M0020

- Departing from BIKF, Keflavik NAS, Iceland

- Aircraft Type is one KC-135

- Callsign is EURO41

- VUL time it will be covering 2330Z-0400Z

Let's see what can be obtained from line #2

- Area hold will be the AR2 air refueling anchor.

- The aircraft will push at 0045Z which is the on station time. For the tanker.

- Mission category is Air Refueling.

- Altitude block will be FL240

- Mission is fragged for refueling operations on Anchor AR2

- Last two field are not applicable

Now as you can see lines 3-5 are a bit different than the missions we decoded earlier and that is because it is a tanker mission, let's see what we obtain from line three.

- AR2 is still our AR Anchor as previously stated

- ARCT is 0115Z

- Altitude FL240

- Rendezvous type is Fighter Turn On

- Offload will be 10,000 pounds.

- Receivers will be WEASL 11-12 flight.

So looks like WEASL 11 flight is going to refuel at 0115Z with EURO 41 who will be on at AR2 at FL240 and will offload 5,000 lbs each for a total of 10,000 lbs of fuel to the flight. We won't decode lines 4 and 5 since they are essentially the same as line 3.

There you go, we have decoded our Third ATO mission.

# Chapter 1 -- Purpose, Objective, and Planning Guidelines

1. **Purpose.** The vUSAF Exercise Program (vAFEP) exists to enhance readiness and improve crisis response. It outlines procedures for organizing military exercises and for distributing the results throughout the vUSAF. Guidance found in this instruction applies to vUSAF participation in joint, combined, and Combat Air Forces (CAF) exercises.

2. **Objectives.** The vAFEP goal is to maximize the benefits gained through exercises. Specifically, it strives to enhance readiness, boost combat capability, streamline procedures, and improve system support. It defines procedures for:

    1. Planning, executing, and evaluating Air Force exercise participation.

    2. Selecting objectives and analyzing exercise results.

    3. After-action reporting to address up-channel and down-channel requirements.

    4. Identifying problems that affect combat readiness, assigning responsibility for corrective action, and ensuring that corrective action is applied.

3. **Air Force Key Exercises and Experiments.** Certain key exercises are of major importance to the vUSAF since they can have an impact on future vUSAF force structure, doctrine, and employment concepts. These exercises often include vUSAF initiatives associated with technology, concept experiments, and doctrine evaluations and require increased attention at the vUSAF Air Staff and major command (MAJCOM) levels. Exercises designated as vUSAF key exercises are contained by the vUSAF/A2. These exercises require special coordination, education, and training during exercise planning and execution.

4. **Planning Guidelines.**

    1. Priorities. If possible, rank priorities when sourcing resources for exercise participation according to sponsorship, following this order:

        1. vUSAF Air Staff Operations

        2. MAJCOMs Exercises

        3. Units Exercises

        4. Other Service Exercises

    2. Concept. Embody the "train the way we fight" concept. Apply real world command relationships when possible. Emphasize participation and reduce artificialities (notional forces and events) to assess actual abilities and limits consistent with safety, exercise objectives, security, mission accomplishment, and other real-world constraints. Make sure logistics, support, and force protection requirements are fully integrated with operational requirements.

    3. Coordination. Coordinate MAJCOM and Unit sponsored exercises with vUSAF/A2 and vUSAF/A3.

    4. Support Requirements. Establish logistics requirements that reflect capabilities likely to exist under real world conditions

    5. Relevancy. MAJCOMs ensure that unit exercises prepare units to master the full range of their contingency taskings, anticipated combat taskings, and noncombat contingency taskings (such as natural disasters, terrorist threats, etc.).

    6. Objective. Develop specific objectives for each exercise. As part of this effort, review operational, logistical, support, and force protection requirements, command relationships, applicable plans, AARs, lessons learned databases, corrective action reports, observation reports, inspection reports, and guidance from higher headquarters. Ensure that the exercise's design, artificial inputs, level and extent of player participation, and scenario support the exercise objectives.

    7. OPSEC and COMSEC Policy. Follow operations security (OPSEC) and communications security (COMSEC) guidance.

    8. Players. Use exercises to train the way you intend to fight for all levels, for example, from flight lead to theater commander. A combination of both experienced and inexperienced players at all levels will significantly enhance exercise effectiveness. Integrate the Air Reserve Components (ARCs), in the exercise to further the concept of total force.

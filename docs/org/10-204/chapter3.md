# Chapter 3 -- The Exercise Cycle

1. **Planning Phase.** The planning phase encompasses all aspects of designing and developing exercises. NOTE: The following discussion is provided as a guideline for the development of exercises. (Timelines may be adjusted as necessary.) Thorough exercise planning involves:

    1. Defining the concept. The exercise concept guides and focuses the planning effort. The concept determines the type (i.e., Large Force Employment (LFE), Search-and-Rescue (SAR) Operational Readiness Inspection (ORI), etc.), duration, and level of exercise play. It identifies the major participants, systems, plans, procedures, and activities. It includes a review of results from previous exercises and lessons learned.

    2. Setting Objectives. Exercise objectives are precise, action-oriented statements of the goals of the exercise. Previous exercise After-Action Reports (AARs), observation reports, publications and directives, mission requirements, and procedures, training requirements, inspection or evaluation results, mission area analyses, and current doctrine issues are all sources to consider when developing exercise objectives. Exercise objectives may also be used to determine if previously identified deficiencies have been resolved or if the suspected deficiencies actually exist. vUSAF exercise objectives should be feasible. Resource limitations should be considered to ensure the vUSAF receives the greatest return for its resource expenditure. This process may be completed 12 months prior to STARTEX.

    3. Designing the exercise. In developing the Exercise Plan (EXPLAN), consider:

        1. Type of event and location

        2. Required level of play for exercise participants to include:

            1. The full duration of the exercise.

            2. Mission Dates and times and always use ZULU for both. Note: This is very complicated due to the different time zones that pilots live in and most forget to covert the times. Consider doing two times a day to allow for maximum participation. Also avoid scheduling exercises around major holidays as turnout might not be the best.

        3. Participating units:

            1. Send invitation letters to all participating organizations and ask for available assets.

            2. Create an e-mail distribution list

            3. Consider allowing MQT students to participate if they are accompanied by an IP or an experienced flight lead. An IP is preferred in order to complete training requirements.

        4. Review local ARTCC Center website and contact the ARTCC Center event coordinator for the following:

            1. Local ATC procedures to include use of SUA, GCI, AWACS.

            2. Letter of agreement with local ATC for use of SUA (if required)

            3. Have Center issue NOTAM for event

            4. Sector File for GCI/AWACS

        5. Post basic exercise information (dates, proposed mission times, general exercise overview) on the VATSIM Forum under VSOA Operations

        6. Scenery. Determine what scenery is required and what is currently available. Some special scenery might need to be developed for the air base and the SUA such as drop zones, forward operating locations, landing zones, SAMs, other targets and SAR.

        7. Aircraft textures. For units from other VSOA organizations, request which aircraft they are using to be able to provide links to all participants.

        8. Background material necessary to set the stage and conduct the exercise. It is highly recommended before posting to covert these documents over to a PDF format.

            1. Inflight Guide (IFG) to include:

                1. Airport Diagram with parking spots

                2. Preferred routings to and from the airspace

                3. Communications plan

                4. Special Use Air Space (MOA, AR, etc) to include diagrams, vertical and horizontal limitations, coordinates.

                5. SIDS/STARS and Instrument Approach plates

            2. Intelligence

            3. Deployment Plan. Each unit needs to develop a deployment plan for airlift requirements to be tasked to AMC.

            4. Warning Order (WARNORD) (See Chapter 4)

            5. Special Instructions (SPINS) (See Chapter 5)

            6. Air Tasking Order (ATO) (See Chapter 6)

            7. Mission Flow Card (See Chapter 7)

            8. Mission Briefing (See Chapter 8)

        9. vUSAF Current Operations Forum.

            1. Submit a ticket to add a folder to the vUSAF Current Operations forums and include the following:

                1. Exercise Name

                2. Moderators for the forum

            2. Use the Upcoming Events forum in the Current Operations section to post the dates and times of the mission. Also recommend the following:

                1. Indicate in the text area the dates and times in Zulu and for the US based pilots, convert dates and times to Eastern, Central, Mountain and Pacific.

                2. Indicate mission type and the desired minimum number of aircraft that will be required to execute the mission.

                3. Have pilots RSVP with aircraft type they plan on flying.

        10. vUSAF GCI/AWACS:

            1. Contact vUSAF Air Control Command and request GCI Controllers. This essential for mission flows and overall command and control

            2. GCI controllers should not be performing ATC services

        11. Radio Communications: Develop a communications plan with primary and secondary frequencies. Recommend that the secondary frequency does not use the same server as the primary frequency. Ensure that the communications that are used utilizes the most current vUSAF FSInn Radio File. NOTE: In order to view the current FSInn Radio, open with Notepad and at the end of the file is a list of the frequencies and their uses.

        12. Exercise Website. Develop a simple one-page site for one-stop shopping for scenery, sector files, links to aircraft, items as listed 3.1.3.8. and anything else you'd like. You can request web space from the vUSAF Webmaster or you can create one on Google Groups for free.

2. **Preparation Phase.** During the preparation phase, the approved EXPLAN and supporting documents are distributed, and pre-exercise training is developed and conducted.

3. **Execution Phase.** The execution phase begins at STARTEX and continues until ENDEX.

    1. Exercise planners manage the direction, pace, and intensity of exercise play. Planners form an exercise control group (ECG) tailored to the exercise type, objectives, and participating organizations. Typical ECG functions include:

        1. Overseeing exercise play.

        2. Monitoring exercise inputs.

        3. Coordinating actions in regulating or modifying the exercise scenario.

    2. Data collectors gather exercise data according to the Data Collection Plan, if developed. Normally, the same person should not perform both data collection and planner functions. However, for small-scale exercises, planners could also collect data. Data collectors should be informed of changes to exercise events.

4. **Post-Exercise Analysis Phase.** The post-exercise analysis phase includes postexercise AAR and evaluation actions. It focuses on the exercise objectives, documents exercise results, and provides feedback to exercise players and others. The exercise analysis may range in scope from a simple AAR to a comprehensive detailed analysis report. Data is evaluated to determine accomplishment of the objectives. The goal is to determine whether or not exercise objectives have been met. If not, the analysis should identify and define deficiencies or shortcomings and provide suggestions for possible changes to existing plans, policies, procedures, and systems. If the objectives were met, the analysis should document those current plans, policies, procedures, and systems are adequate. It should also identify any successful work-arounds exercise players developed. Completing AARs and distributing exercise results are important final steps.

5. **Post-Exercise Reporting Phase.** Refer to Chapter 9, vUSAF After-Action Reporting System (AARS), for more details on post-exercise reporting requirements.

# Chapter 4 -- The Warning Order (WARNORD)

1. **The Warning Order (WARNORD).** The WARNORD establishes command relationships (designating supported and supporting commanders) and provides the mission, objectives, and known constraints. It establishes a tentative C-day and L-hour. It may apportion capabilities for planning purposes or task the combatant commander to develop a list of forces required to confront the crisis. A warning order does not authorize movement of forces unless specifically stated. If the crisis is progressing rapidly, a planning order or alert order may be issued instead.

2. **WARNORD Format.** The following format will be used when creating the WARNORD. A sample can be found at Attachment 4.

    1. PURPOSE. Indicate the purpose of the mission. Example: Establishes the 404 AEG to defend the Iceland ADIZ.

    2. SITUATION DEVELOPING. Indicate a short narrative of the situation, tasked units and other security related issues.

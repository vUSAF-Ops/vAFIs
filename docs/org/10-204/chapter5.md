# Chapter 5 -- Special Instructions (SPINS)

1. **Special Instructions (SPINS).** The SPINS is the document that establishes all of the in-flight rules for the exercise. The SPINS define many different aspects of the mission and is used when building the ATO and Flow Cards. When building SPINS, the following should be considered:

    1. Introduction. Describe a broad overview of the mission.

    2. Objectives. Overall objectives of the exercise.

    3. Execution Overview: Where the training scenarios are, how missions are tasked, where the POCs are listed and who is responsible for overall planning of assigned mission package.

    4. Exercise Administration. Indicate that each training period has a specific vulnerability period (VUL time) and that "Fight's On" is at the beginning of the VUL time. Sub sections should include the following:

        1. Required Equipment/FS Addons. Indicate items that are required to participate in the exercise such as scenery, aircraft textures, FSInn Radio file, etc.

        2. Mission Planning: When to expect the ATO and who is to plan the mission.

        3. Airspace: Indicate the airspace that will be used and any limits on altitude for the exercise. For example, DF0901 will utilize the Desert MOA from SFC to 30K, R4808 from SFC to 50K. AR641 will be used for air refueling.

        4. Separation of Forces. Describe the safe areas, the Cap Limit Line (CLL)/Marshall Limit Line (MLL) and if High Value Assets (HVAA) will be in the safe area and if not if they will be considered to be targets.

        5. Air Refueling Operations. Indicate the air refueling tracks that will be used and any information for that refueling track.

        6. HVAA Operations. Describe if a single HVAA (E-3 and/or tanker) will be used for both teams and how early they need to be established on station before the VUL time.

        7. Admin: Indicate what is required for each of these items:

            1. Deconfliction plan. Who is responsible for deconflicting the flights entry/exit points, on/off targets, etc.

            2. Air-to-air ordnance loads. Example Air-to-air ordnance loads will be limited to one ordnance load per sortie. Upon kill regeneration, ordnance load will be re-established.

            3. Procedures for filing of flight plans. (i.e. Routes, remarks, etc)

            4. Squawk Codes. Example: Flight Lead will squawk 04 and the last two of the mission number (i.e. Mission M0431= 0431). Wingmen will squawk sequentially. For example, if JOLLY11 mode 3 is 0431, then JOLLY12 mode 3 is 0432 and JOLLY13 mode 3 is 0433. Once in a standard formation, wingman will squawk standby.

            5. Communications Plan. Show the flow of the radios.

            6. Kill Removal/Regeneration. Indicate how the killed aircraft will regenerate. Some examples are head to the tanker to refuel or hold in the safe area for 10 minutes. Also indicate any other restrictions such as altitude, speeds, etc.

            7. IMC Procedures and Restrictions: Indicate what to do if the weather is bad. One example is if the SUA is IMC to switch to CAVOK upon entry and when exiting go back to real weather.

            8. Rules of Engagement: Indicate anything different from vAFI 11-415, vUSAF Combat Rules of Engagement.

            9. Combat Search and Rescue: Discuss the following items:

                1. Command and Control Component. Who will the AMC be if there is no GCI and who will be the OSC.

                2. CSAR Procedures. Communication procedures, evader callsign, use of letter, word or number of the week.

                3. Authentication Codes

                4. Aircrew Radio Procedures

                5. SANDY Aircraft Procedures

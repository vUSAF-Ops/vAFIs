# Chapter 6 -- Air Tasking Order (ATO)

1. **The Air Tasking Order (ATO)**. The ATO is the document that designates all of the missions for the exercise. The hardest part of deciphering the ATO is finding your specific mission. The mission tasking includes all of the mission specifics. Essential items such as aircraft type, Mode 3 codes, refueling altitudes, off/on-loads and call sign are clearly stated in the text line of the tasking. Depicted in Attachment 5 are examples of ATO tasking format. As with anything, the format may not be consistent between exercises, but the example illustrates the basic format.

    1. Developing the mission for the Air Tasking Order (ATO).

        1. Determine the mission that is to be conducted (i.e. Airdrop, SEAD, STRIKE, SAR, etc) and any support mission that might be required (i.e. Escort, SEAD, AR, etc). Mission types can be found in Attachment 2.

        2. Next determine the type and number of aircraft required.

        3. Now determine the flow of the mission. Typically for a Red Flag type of mission, the AWACS and tankers depart first to the area which is typically in a no-threat area. Next the bombers and fighters depart to their assigned pre-push holding areas which are behind the Marshall Limit Line (MLL). Remember to use standard departure routing to the areas, entry points and to deconflict altitudes and times crossing these points.

        4. Once the players begin to show-up at the hold areas, a mission push time will need to be established for each mission. Some items to consider for example are, if you have a STRIKE package going to a target that has ground-to-air threats (i.e., AAA, SAMs), you'd push your SEAD package first to eliminate that threat. Likewise, if there is an air-to-air threat, you'd want to send an ESCORT with the SEAD package and with the STRIKE package to counter this threat.

        5. Once the mission is pushed and complete, determine if the aircraft needs to stay on-station for another mission or if the aircraft can return to base (RTB). Depending on the fuel state of the aircraft, they should be tasked to refuel especially if conducting a second mission. For refueling planning requirements, see Attachment 3. If aircraft is not RTB, post refueling send aircraft back to a holding area.

        6. Establish push time for second missions and follow the guidance for the first mission.

        7. Once aircraft are RTB, be sure to use the SUA exit points and return published departures and to again deconflict altitudes and times.

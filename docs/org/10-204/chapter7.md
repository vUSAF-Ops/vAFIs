# Chapter 7 -- Flow Card

1. **The Flow Card.** The mission flow card is a quick reference tool used by the crews and AWACS/GCI controllers. The card typically has mission data for all tasked flights, authentication table, code-words, frequency table and communications flow. This card should be filled out by the overall mission commander using the ATO and SPINS, but typically the exercise planner fills in the card. When the card is filled out, it should depict the takeoff flow and deconflict all entry and exit points. This is useful for GCI/AWACS controllers and also if there are no controllers online. An example of the card is located in Attachment 7 and can be downloaded from the vUSAF Resource Center.

    1. Mission Data. In the mission block, extract from the ATO the Callsign, Aircraft Type, Squawk Code, ARCT, Hold Point, Hold Altitude, Push Time, and Targets. From that data, the overall mission commander or planner can flight plan and determine the Takeoff Time, Range Entry/Exit Information to include Entry/Exit Point, Altitude and Time to meet the mission timing.

    2. Authentication Table. Extract this information from the SPINS and build the table.

    3. Code Words. Extract this information from the SPINS and build the table.

    4. Frequency Table. Extract this information from the Inflight Guide and SPINS.

    5. Communications Flow. Indicate how they players should setup their radios. Here is a typical setup:

        1. COMM1 - ATC/UNICOM/TACTICAL

        2. COMM2 - FIGHT FREQ/AR/CAS

        3. COMM3 - MISSON

        4. Discord - Private Interplane

        5. SATCOM - MSG/CHAT

2. **Brevity Words, Code Words, and Tactical Execution.** The SPINS will define the point at which to proceed "tactical." At this point, cancel IFR with ATC and check in with the appropriate controlling agency at the designated point (usually defined in the SPINS). In addition, change your mode 3 to the designated values (fragged against your mission in the ATO). The frequency for check in is designated by controlling agency in the SPINS. An example of an initial check in could be: "BLACKJACK, PAWN21 checks point tango, angels base plus 150, request picture north." A typical response would be "PAWN21, BLACKJACK has you Sweet Sweet, picture north clear. You are cleared highway, fragged angels." Most communications will use a combination of these brevity words and designated code words. Code words are defined in the SPINS and usually change on a weekly basis. These words are words that convey specific meaning other than the obvious. The most commonly referred words are listed in Attachment 6.

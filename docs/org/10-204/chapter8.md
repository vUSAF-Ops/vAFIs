# Chapter 8 -- Mission Briefing

1. **Mission Briefing.** The mission briefing is the full mission brief that pilots can follow along during the ground briefing before flying. The brief is power point slide show that is converted over to a PDF format. Typical sections of the brief include:

    1. Cover slide that has the exercise/operation name, briefer, date and briefing classification.

    2. Overview. The slide is the "what I'm going to tell you"-slide. It should include as a minimum Mission Overviews, Objectives, Regulations, Airfield Parking, Communications, Taxi/Departures, Airspace, Air Refueling Tracks, Recoveries and Mission Reports (MISREPS).

    3. Mission Overviews. This is a basic slide that shows the teams and the basic mission objective. A second slide can be included also that depicts a big picture view of the airspace, safe areas, holding point, targets and refueling areas. Another example of the mission overview is to move these slides to after the airspace/air refueling tracks slides and break down each individual mission.

    4. Objectives. List the objectives for the mission.

    5. Regulations. List the regulations that govern the mission. Some might include the Inflight Guide, ATO, SPINS, local ARTCC website information, etc.

    6. Airfield Parking. There are two ways to accomplish this. One is to have a diagram of the airfield and indicate where the units should be parked. Another is to assign each unit parking spots via an AFCAD file. Combining both would be the best.

    7. Communications. Have a listing of the frequencies and on another slide, use one mission and describe the COMM Flow Plan for that mission.

    8. Taxi Procedures. List any airfield specific taxi procedures and any other local procedures that the crew might need to be aware of. Also list the preferred departure procedures to the area.

    9. Airspace. Display an overview of the airspace that is being used. Include boundary coordinates, altitudes, entry/exit points and any other information that might be available for the airspace.

    10. Air Refueling Tracks. Display an overview of the AR track, AR Track points, altitudes, communications, and any restrictions.

    11. Recovery. List the preferred arrival procedures and any other local procedures that might be applicable.

    12. Mission Reports (MISREP). Indicate procedures on how report that the mission was complete back to the mission commander.

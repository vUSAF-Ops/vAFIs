# Chapter 9 -- After Action Reporting System (AARS)

1. **Purpose.** The vUSAF After-Action Reporting System (AARS) provides procedures for documenting exercise and operations results, identifying and correcting problems, identifying trends, and disseminating results.

2. **Reporting Instructions.** AARS applies to all vUSAF elements that participate in other joint exercises, vUSAF exercises, and real-world operations. It also applies to humanitarian, base closure, peacekeeping, and noncombatant evacuation operations (NEO). vUSAF Air Staff, MAJCOMs, and Units must establish internal after-action reporting procedures that ensure AARS objectives are met, problems are solved, and results are disseminated. Send an information copy of reports to the vUASF/A2 and A3.

3. **Types of Reports.** The documentation in these reports is essential for planning subsequent exercises and operations and validating corrections. vUSAF/A3 may modify these requirements for individual exercises and operations.

    1. Lesson Learned. The lesson learned is the most common type of submission. A lesson learned is defined as a technique, procedure, or practical work-around that enabled a task to be accomplished to standard based on an identified deficiency or shortcoming. For lessons learned that identify a problem requiring action at vUSAF Air Staff level, MAJCOMs, and units will forward a lesson learned report to vUSAF/A2 not later than (NLT) 45 days following an exercise or operation.

    2. Issue Report. Issue reports are similar to lessons learned in that they identify a shortcoming, deficiency, or problem identified during an operation or training event but do not include a work-around or solution. Include the word "Issue" in the report title (example, "Issue -- FSInn Radio File did not work for 50% of the player"). For issues that identify a problem requiring action at vUSAF Air Staff level, MAJCOMs, and units prepare and submit an Issue Report to vUSAF/A2 NLT 45 days following an exercise or operation.

    3. Observation Report. Observation Reports document a technique or circumstance that significantly impacted an operation or training event and should be shared with the Air Force and joint community. Include the word "Observation" in the report title (example, "Observation -- Unit Designed Scheduling Template Reduced Deployed Workload"). For observations that are to be shared with vUSAF Air Staff, MAJCOMs, and units prepare and submit Observation Reports to vUSAF/A2 NLT 45 days following an exercise or operation.

    4. Word document format for Lessons Learned Report. The primary method for reporting a Lessons Learned/Issue/Observation Report is through a word document that contains the essential information. Provide the following information in your report:

        1. ORIGINATOR: POC Name/Rank.

        2. CONTACT INFORMATION: E-mail

        3. EVENT NAME: Operation/Exercise/Experiment Name, i.e., OPERATION NORTHERN VIKING/EXERCISE RED FLAG 08-3.

        4. TITLE: (If an Issue or Observation start the title with "Issue" or "Observation")

        5. OBSERVATION: Define the problem.

        6. DISCUSSION: Provide the who, what, where, when, why, and how.

        7. LESSON LEARNED: Describe a better process, a work-around, a new solution.

    5. Summary Report. Summary Reports document and provide a description of operations and exercises including dates, locations, objectives, major participants, and limitations. Participating MAJCOMs, and units prepare and submit after-action summary. Submit reports NLT 30 days following an exercise or operation.

    6. Word document format for Summary Report. The primary method for reporting a Summary Report is through a word document that contains the essential information. Provide the following information in your report:

        1. ORIGINATOR: POC Name/Rank.

        2. CONTACT INFORMATION: E-mail

        3. EVENT NAME: Operation/Exercise/Experiment Name, i.e., OPERATION NORTHERN VIKING/EXERCISE RED FLAG 08-3.

        4. TITLE: (If an Issue or Observation start the title with "Issue" or "Observation")

        5. GENERAL DESCRIPTION: General executive type overview of the event.

        6. DATES: Inclusive dates when event occurred.

        7. LOCATION OF OPERATIONS: Physical location of event.

        8. LOCATION OF PERSONNEL: Where the personnel operations were conducted (List applicable forward/rear locations).

        9. OBJECTIVES: What were the reasons you participated in the event.

        10. LIMITATIONS: What hampered you from meeting your objectives (Submit Lessons Learned/Issue/Observation Report for each limitation.

        11. MAJOR PARTICIPANTS: Unit, squadron, wing designations of participants.

4. Report Submitting Procedures. Commands and reporting units submit reports via email to the vUSAF/A2 and copy the vUSAF/A3

5. Analysis and Dissemination.

    1. After-Action Reports (AARs) received by vUSAF/A2 are reviewed and analyzed. Reports that apply to other vUSAF organizations are placed in the A2 database for dissemination.

    2. MAJCOMs should maintain a command database. Analyze observation reports to identify and quickly correct developing adverse trends before they impact resources and operations. Review command databases semiannually and disseminate lessons learned through vUSAF/A2.

1. **Purpose:** The purpose of this document is to outline in detail the administrative structure of the Virtual United States Air Force. This guidance will describe in detail the component structures and their respective positions and duty descriptions.

2. **Organizational entities:** The Virtual United States Air Force (vUSAF) is comprised of establishments, units and non-units.

    1. **Establishment:** An organizational entity consisting of a headquarters unit and its subordinate units. The name of the establishment is in the name of the headquarters units. For example, Air Mobility Command (AMC) is an establishment; HQ AMC is its headquarters. Subordinate units are assigned to the establishment and not its headquarters unit.

        1. A group with subordinate squadrons is generally the lowest-level establishment. Lower-level establishments are assigned to higher-level ones; for example, Groups to Wings, Wings to NAFs, MAFs to MAJCOMs, MAJCOMs to HQ vUSAF. This arrangement (units reporting to establishments, subordinate units' establishments to superior ones) sets up the Chain of Command (CoC) through which, all accountability and control flow.

        2. Establishments facilitate organizational actions. For example, the reassignment of a wing (establishment) from one NAF to another automatically reassigns the wing's subordinate units.

    2. **Unit:** A military organization constituted by directives issued by HQ vUSAF. A unit is either named or numbered.

        1. A unit helps provide for an unbroken chain of command (CoC) since military personnel must be assigned to a unit at all times. Each unit having military members must have an officer designated as its commander.

        2. Terms that apply to a unit:

            1. **Active unit:** A major command (MAJCOM) constituted and activated by HQ vUSAF; or a subordinate unit constituted by HQ vUSAF, assigned to a MAJCOM, and activated by special order.

            2. **Inactive unit:** A unit constituted by HQ vUSAF but not yet activated or a unit constituted, activated and subsequently, inactivated.

            3. **Disbanded unit:** A unit whose legal authority for existence has been withdrawn by HQ vUSAF. Its designation is retired and preserved in historical records.

            4. **Parent unit:** An organization that directly administers units, detachments, or operating locations assigned to it.

            5. **Provisional unit:** A temporary unit organized to perform a specific task.

            6. **Attached unit:** A unit, or part of a unit, placed under the control of another organization for the specific purpose such as operational control, administrative control, or logistical support. It is the assigned to the parent unit.

            7. **Detached unit:** A unit serving away from its organization of assignment. It may function independently or may be attached to another organization.

            8. **Primary subordinate unit:** A unit that performs part or the entire primary mission of the organization to which it is assigned. The unit reports to the commander of the parent organization and has full authority to execute its assigned mission.

3. **vUSAF organization:** The organization of the vUSAF does not fully duplicate the real structure of the United States Air Force since the vUSAF is a virtual, hobby orientated organization using flight simulators and the internet, thus some areas of the actual United States Air Force are not needed or have no practical function in the virtual world. It shall be noted that the vUSAF shall be operated as closely as possible to that of the actual United State Air Force in its peacetime role. With a high regard for prototypical operation thereof.

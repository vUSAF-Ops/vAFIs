**Purpose:** This instruction is designed to provide you the pilot with the tools and resources necessary to have an effective and enjoyable career with the Virtual United States Air Force. This should be considered as a general reference for your conduct with this organization; however, it does not supersede any other directives or instructions.

**Background:** The Virtual United States Air Force (vUSAF) was founded in 1999 as the primary force component of the United Nations Air Forces (UNAF), which in 2002 evolved into the Virtual Air Traffic Simulation Network (VATSIM) Special Operations Administration (VSOA). Under the VATSIM Special Operations Administration, each service department (or affiliate branch) is tasked with providing a replication of its real-world entity in order to provide the VATSIM and virtual aviation community with an avenue to experience and enjoy the challenges of military aviation. In the effort to recreate the United States Air Force, the VUSAF offer its members a realistic operation including airfield location, airframes, training, rank, policy and procedures. Above all the VUSAF strives to meet its core values of Enjoyment, Education and Excellence for its members. Achieving this mission, the VUSAF fulfills its goal of providing a highly motivated and well-trained branch over operational efficiency and realism to the entire body of affiliates of the VATSIM Special Operations Administration.

As a VATSIM VSOA all members must use their real first and last name when applying for membership and must have a valid VATSIM ID Number. Failure to use your real first and last name when applying for VATSIM or vUSAF membership and/or failing to have a valid VATSIM ID Number will be cause for immediate dismissal from the vUSAF.

1. **General Operating Rules of the vUSAF.** We are all not fond of rules, but we need to have some, that is what makes us a unique virtual organization. We are modeled after the military so please understand there is a reason for the following.

    1. **Initial Training Requirements:** All applicants will be required to participate in the Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT) program, before being assigned a duty station and aircraft. This is a must due to our affiliation with the VATSIM, Special Operations Administration (VSOA). The very nature of our aircraft and missions, require us to ensure that each member is capable of performing adequately. Therefore, we have instituted a flight-training program that all flying members must participate in. For advanced pilots, an abbreviated syllabus is in place to give a quick overview of aircraft and capabilities.

    2. **Flying Requirements:**

        1. **Active Duty:**

            1. **All active duty vUSAF members are required to fly a minimum of two (2) flights a month on VATSIM (at least one hour per flight).** Any pilot who fails to maintain that status will be notified via their chain of command. If the pilot does not post a Pilot\'s Report (PIREP) within ten days of the notice indicating that they have not flown the two required flights, they will be sent to the Inactive reserves for a period of 30 days and if not heard from in that time period will be administratively separated. There is no restriction as to the number of flights per month.

            2. In addition, pilots are expected to participate in all VUSAF sponsored events and deployments. Flights that are flown in the event count towards your monthly participation.

        2. **All Pilots:** All pilots will be required to maintain mission qualification status in the primary aircraft assigned. All pilots must refer to, and comply with, the requirements of vAFI 11-202 as they relate to the currency requirements for their primary aircraft.

        3. **Other Considerations:** It is also understood that this is a simulated organization and that sometimes pilots may not be able to fly the required flights in the time limit. Should this situation arise, pilots should submit a Leave of Absence (LOA) request via their chain of command. The request officially documents inactivity, therefore not being sent to the non-active reserves. Along with the request, pilots should, if possible, state the reason for the request and give an approximate date of return to active flying status.

    3. **Assigned and Additional Flights:** All members will be assigned a flight from their respective commanders. If a member would like an additional flight over the required flights, he/she may accomplish such without being assigned and indicate to the commander via e-mail (if a blanket policy is in effect with the Wing Commander or higher) that they are conducting such flight and then by marking the applicable box on the MISsion REPort (MISREP).

        1. Periodically there will be a list of approved missions available on the VUSAF website. Pilots are not required to receive approval to perform these published missions as long as they remain within the published mission profile.

    4. **MISREPS:** All members are required to file a mission report at the completion of their assignments, to include mission assignment numbers on all weekly missions. The information from these reports are compiled and posted to the appropriate 201 files and commands on a weekly basis if not more. Therefore, it is required that all mission reports to be filed as soon as practical after a mission to ensure expedient and concise recording of completed missions and proper credit.

    5. **Leave-of-Absence (LOA):** Members who require a leave of absence may make such a request from their COC for whatever reason, below the following levels may grant the specified amount of leave:

        1. Squadron Commander: Up to 2 weeks.

        2. Wing Commander: Up to 1 month.

        3. NAF Commander: Up to 2 months.

        4. MAJCOM Commander: Up to 3 months.

        5. For leave for longer periods of time a letter of explanation must be generated and sent through the CoC to AF/A3 and vCoS for consideration. The officer approving the Leave of Absence shall enter the LOA for the member.

        6. Members who are placed on a LOA greater than six (6) months will be placed into the inactive reserves. All members placed on extended leave of absence shall be required to comply with requirements established in vAFI 11-202 in regards to mission readiness.

    6. **VUSAF Chief of Staff -- Rights:**

Staff shall take into consideration that membership within the vUSAF is all volunteer and a hobby, as such, considerations shall be made in respect to compliance with such NOTAMS/MEMORANDUMS.

7. **Promotions and Awards:**

    1. vUSAF award and promotion criteria are established in vAFI 36-103, please contact your CoC for this document.

    2. In addition to vAFI36-103, in order to create stability of rank throughout the organization, the following rules apply for promotions:

        1. When a member is given a discretionary promotion for a command position, that member must:

            1. Remain in that position or a higher position for a minimum time in grade of one (1) year to retain that rank for retirement or;

            2. If less than one (1) year time in grade, meet the requirements for the rank that they are assigned.

            3. If the member is unable to meet the requirement, upon resigning from their command position, they will be returned to a rank commensurate to their new position and in no case shall it be lower than their previous rank prior to appointment of command or Captain (O-3), whichever is higher.

        2. In addition, for members who meet the one (1) year time in grade and then resign from a command position at the rank of Brigadier General (0-7) and above and then elect to become a commander of a lesser position or a line pilot, that member will be required to be reduced to rank of the position they are filling or to Colonel (0-6). Upon retirement, the member will be restored to the highest rank obtained during their VUSAF career. The reason for this is to allow wing commanders and above a manageable command structure.

8. **VATSIM Usage and Affiliation:** The vUSAF is affiliated with the VATSIM network and its subsequent SPECIAL OPERATIONS ADMINISTRATION and has been a member in good standing for many years. It goes without saying that the vUSAF and its personnel shall follow all applicable policy and procedure established by VATSIM while sing the VATSIM network.

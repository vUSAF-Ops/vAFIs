Destruction of the enemy surface force is the most direct of the effects of air interdiction. Disruption of enemy surface forces can be accomplished in a number of ways. This can include traditional supply targets such as ammunition or POL, LOCs used to transport the enemy force into combat, C2 systems that the enemy army requires to fight effectively, or anything else that the enemy force depends on for success in combat. Different types of Air Interdiction missions are defined based upon the types of targets encountered. a. Pre-planned Air Interdiction (AI). AI is the designation given to air interdiction missions against pre-planned targets in the ATO. This mode is used to hit specific targets that are known in advance, and detailed intelligence information is available to support strike planning.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Airborne Alert Attack for TSTs (AATK). AATK is the ATO designation for Airborne Alert Attack missions assigned with the objective of attrition of designated enemy systems on the TST list. AATK missions will be assigned to an AOR in which the targeted enemy systems are detected or suspected.</p> </li> <li> <p>Airborne Alert Interdiction for TSTs (AAI). AAI is the mission designation in the ATO for TST prosecution when the general location of TSTs is not known. Target type will determine the level of approval authority and degree of coordination required. Assignment to AAI in the ATO means you are placed in an area to hold, pending location and/or identification of a TST to strike.</p> </li> <li> <p>Armed Reconnaissance (AREC). AREC is the designation for armed reconnaissance, also known as \"armed recce\" in the ATO. It is a form of air interdiction that is planned against a particular area, rather than a particular target. Armed reconnaissance is normally flown into areas where lucrative targets on the CPT list are known or suspected to exist, or where mobile enemy surface units have moved to as a result of ground fighting. The area may be defined by as a stretch of an LOC such as a railroad, highway, or river. AREC missions must satisfy deconfliction measures and any additional ROE prior to striking any targets discovered in their AOR.</p> </li> <li> <p>Strike Coordination and Reconnaissance (SCR). SCR is the designation for missions planned against a particular area for targets on the CPT list. The baseline SCR mission assignment, also known as Killer-Scout, is to find and PID targets for coordinated strikes by other force application assets. The SCR is a facilitator of target detection and pairing within a prescribed AOR. When working with other assets to coordinate an attack, the authority to engage or abort must be considered as equal among the entities. ROE, PID, CDE and deconfliction are shared responsibilities between SCR and the assets they coordinate with to attack targets. Any asset has the authority to suspend or abort an attack if coordination measures do not comply with established criteria for a given attack platform. SCR leads are not trained to provide CAS terminal control, and should never be used to control attacks inside close proximity to friendly ground forces.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>COUNTER AIR- The objectives of the counter-air function are to enable friendly operations against the enemy and protect friendly forces and vital assets through control of the air. Counter-air is directed at enemy forces and target sets that directly (airborne aircraft, surface-to-air missiles) or indirectly (airfields; petroleum, oils, and lubricants; command and control facilities) challenge control of the air. Counter-air consists of offensive and defensive operations. Offensive Counter Air consists of offensive operations aimed at destroying, disrupting, or degrading enemy air and missile threats. Defensive Counter Air includes actions taken against enemy aircraft and missile attacks.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Offensive Counter Air- Offensive Counter Air includes targets such as enemy air defense systems (aircraft, antiaircraft artillery, and surface-to-air missiles), airfields and supporting infrastructure, theater missiles (cruise and ballistic), ground-, sea-, and air-based launch platforms and its supporting infrastructure. Different types of Offensive Counter Air operations are designated to achieve specific counter-air objectives.</p> </li> <li> <p>Surface Attack (OCA). OCA is designation in the ATO given to Surface Attack missions against pre-planned offensive counter air targets. Surface Attack missions are intended to destroy, disrupt, or degrade select offensive counter-air targets on the ground. These missions are directed against enemy air and missile threats and their support infrastructure (e.g., airfields, launch sites, launchers, runways) before launch. The main goal is to prevent enemy air and missile assets from being employed. While many TSTs are offensive counter air targets, the designation AATK or AAI is used to cover missions tasked against the highest-level dynamic targets, regardless of doctrinal categorization.</p> </li> <li> <p>Fighter Sweep (SWEP). SWEP is the designation in the ATO given to Fighter Sweep missions. The fighter sweep is an offensive mission by fighter aircraft to seek out and destroy enemy airborne target sets such as aircraft, airborne missile launch platforms, and airborne targets of opportunity independent of other strike operations.</p> </li> <li> <p>Escort (ESC). ESC is the designation in the ATO given to Escort missions. Escort missions are protection sorties flown over enemy territory against enemy aircraft and air defense systems. Escort missions may be either close or detached with respect to the escorted entity. Friendly aircraft, enroute to or from a target area, may be assigned escort aircraft to protect them from enemy air-to-air threats. Escort aircraft may be tasked to protect such missions as interdiction, reconnaissance, airlift, search and rescue, aerial, airborne C2, and electronic warfare.</p> </li> <li> <p>Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD). SEAD is the designation in the ATO given to Suppression of Enemy Air Defense missions. SEAD is an offensive counter air mission designed to neutralize, destroy, or temporarily degrade enemy surface-based air defenses by destructive or disruptive means. SEAD requirements may vary according to mission objectives, system capabilities, and threat complexity.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>DEFENSIVE COUNTER AIR- The objective of Defensive Counter Air is to protect friendly forces and vital interests from enemy air and missile attacks and is synonymous with air defense. Defensive Counter Air consists of active and passive air defense operations including all defensive measures designed to destroy attacking enemy air and missile threats or to nullify or reduce the effectiveness of such attacks should they escape destruction. The basic active defense criteria to detect, identify, intercept, and destroy remains the same for air and missile threats. Defensive Counter Air missions for fighters include Area Defense, Point Defense, and High Value Airborne Asset (HVAA) protection.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Area Defense (DCA). DCA is the designation for ATO assigned Area Defense fighter missions with a known area or lane to defend over friendly territory for a specific time period. Area defense missions are conducted for the defense of a broad area using a combination of weapon systems.</p> </li> <li> <p>Combat Air Patrol (CAP). CAP is the designation for Point Defense fighter missions known as Combat Air Patrol (CAP) for a specific time period. CAP missions are conducted for the protection of a limited area, normally in defense of the vital elements of forces and installations.</p> </li> <li> <p>High Value Airborne Asset (HVAA) Protection (BRCAP). BRCAP is the designation for fighter missions assigned as a Barrier CAP in defense of HVAAs for a specific time period. HVAA protection uses fighter aircraft to protect critical airborne theater assets such as AWACS and Tankers.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>STRATEGIC ATTACK- Strategic Attack is offensive action conducted by command authorities. Strategic attack generates effects at the strategic level that attain or directly support attainment of strategic-level objectives. It is not focused upon defeat of enemy military forces. Strategic attack is not tied to specific weapon systems or delivery platforms.</p> <ol> <li>Strategic Attack (SA). SA is the designation in the ATO given to Strategic Attack missions against pre-planned strategic targets. While many TSTs are strategic in nature, the designation AAI or AATK is used to cover missions tasked against the highest level dynamic targets.</li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>CLOSE AIR SUPPORT- Close Air Support is defined as air action by fixed and rotary-wing aircraft against hostile targets which are in close proximity to friendly forces and which require detailed integration of each air mission with the fire and movement of those forces. CAS is not defined by a specific region of the theater; rather it can be conducted at any place and time friendly surface forces are in close proximity to enemy forces.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Close Air Support-Scheduled (CAS). CAS is the designation in the ATO given to pre-planned Close Air Support missions with a time-on-target (TOT), and where a need for CAS has been established in advance. Scheduled CAS missions will normally have a specific contact point or area, at a specific time, to expect handoff to a air-based Forward Air Controller (FAC). Scheduled CAS missions are the most likely to have good intelligence on the expected type of target, resulting in a better munitions-target match. Although a specific target must be identified when requesting scheduled CAS, the reality of fluid battlefield environments makes identifying a CAS target days in advance very difficult and may not match those listed in the ATO. Final target determination is at the discretion of the supported ground component.</p> </li> <li> <p>Close Air Support-On Call (GCAS). GCAS is the designations given to air alert or ground alert CAS during a pre-planned time period when the need for CAS is likely, but not guaranteed. GCAS sorties will remain on alert status until scrambled by their Wing Operations Center (WOC).

The vUSAF Exercise Program (vAFEP) exists to enhance readiness and improve crisis response. It outlines procedures for organizing military exercises and for distributing the results throughout the vUSAF. Guidance found in this instruction applies to vUSAF participation in joint, combined, and Combat Air Forces (CAF) exercises.</p> </li> <li> <p>Objectives. The vAFEP goal is to maximize the benefits gained through exercises. Specifically, it strives to enhance readiness, boost combat capability, streamline procedures, and improve system support. It defines procedures for:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Planning, executing, and evaluating Air Force exercise participation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Selecting objectives and analyzing exercise results.</p> </li> <li> <p>After-action reporting to address up-channel and down-channel requirements.</p> </li> <li> <p>Identifying problems that affect combat readiness, assigning responsibility for corrective action, and ensuring that corrective action is applied.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Air Force Key Exercises and Experiments. Certain key exercises are of major importance to the vUSAF since they can have an impact on future vUSAF force structure, doctrine, and employment concepts. These exercises often include vUSAF initiatives associated with technology, concept experiments, and doctrine evaluations and require increased attention at the vUSAF Air Staff and major command (MAJCOM) levels. Exercises designated as vUSAF key exercises are contained by the vUSAF/A2. These exercises require special coordination, education, and training during exercise planning and execution.</p> </li> <li> <p>Planning Guidelines.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Priorities. If possible, rank priorities when sourcing resources for exercise participation according to sponsorship, following this order:</p> <ol> <li> <p>vUSAF Air Staff Operations</p> </li> <li> <p>MAJCOMs Exercises</p> </li> <li> <p>Units Exercises</p> </li> <li> <p>Other Service Exercises</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Concept. Embody the \"train the way we fight\" concept. Apply real world command relationships when possible. Emphasize participation and reduce artificialities (notional forces and events) to assess actual abilities and limits consistent with safety, exercise objectives, security, mission accomplishment, and other real-world constraints. Make sure logistics, support, and force protection requirements are fully integrated with operational requirements.</p> </li> <li> <p>Coordination. Coordinate MAJCOM and Unit sponsored exercises with vUSAF/A2 and vUSAF/A3.</p> </li> <li> <p>Support Requirements. Establish logistics requirements that reflect capabilities likely to exist under real world conditions</p> </li> <li> <p>Relevancy. MAJCOMs ensure that unit exercises prepare units to master the full range of their contingency taskings, anticipated combat taskings, and noncombat contingency taskings (such as natural disasters, terrorist threats, etc.).</p> </li> <li> <p>Objective. Develop specific objectives for each exercise. As part of this effort, review operational, logistical, support, and force protection requirements, command relationships, applicable plans, AARs, lessons learned databases, corrective action reports, observation reports, inspection reports, and guidance from higher headquarters. Ensure that the exercise's design, artificial inputs, level and extent of player participation, and scenario support the exercise objectives.</p> </li> <li> <p>OPSEC and COMSEC Policy. Follow operations security (OPSEC) and communications security (COMSEC) guidance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Players. Use exercises to train the way you intend to fight for all levels, for example, from flight lead to theater commander. A combination of both experienced and inexperienced players at all levels will significantly enhance exercise effectiveness.

The planning phase encompasses all aspects of designing and developing exercises. NOTE: The following discussion is provided as a guideline for the development of exercises. (Timelines may be adjusted as necessary.) Thorough exercise planning involves:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Defining the concept. The exercise concept guides and focuses the planning effort. The concept determines the type (i.e., Large Force Employment (LFE), Search-and-Rescue (SAR) Operational Readiness Inspection (ORI), etc.), duration, and level of exercise play. It identifies the major participants, systems, plans, procedures, and activities. It includes a review of results from previous exercises and lessons learned.</p> </li> <li> <p>Setting Objectives. Exercise objectives are precise, action-oriented statements of the goals of the exercise. Previous exercise After-Action Reports (AARs), observation reports, publications and directives, mission requirements, and procedures, training requirements, inspection or evaluation results, mission area analyses, and current doctrine issues are all sources to consider when developing exercise objectives. Exercise objectives may also be used to determine if previously identified deficiencies have been resolved or if the suspected deficiencies actually exist. vUSAF exercise objectives should be feasible. Resource limitations should be considered to ensure the vUSAF receives the greatest return for its resource expenditure. This process may be completed 12 months prior to STARTEX.</p> </li> <li> <p>Designing the exercise. In developing the Exercise Plan (EXPLAN), consider:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Type of event and location</p> </li> <li> <p>Required level of play for exercise participants to include:</p> <ol> <li> <p>The full duration of the exercise.</p> </li> <li> <p>Mission Dates and times and always use ZULU for both. Note: This is very complicated due to the different time zones that pilots live in and most forget to covert the times. Consider doing two times a day to allow for maximum participation. Also avoid scheduling exercises around major holidays as turnout might not be the best.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Participating units:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Send invitation letters to all participating organizations and ask for available assets.</p> </li> <li> <p>Create an e-mail distribution list</p> </li> <li> <p>Consider allowing MQT students to participate if they are accompanied by an IP or an experienced flight lead.

Recommend that the secondary frequency does not use the same server as the primary frequency. Ensure that the communications that are used utilizes the most current vUSAF FSInn Radio File. NOTE: In order to view the current FSInn Radio, open with Notepad and at the end of the file is a list of the frequencies and their uses.</p> </li> <li> <p>Exercise Website. Develop a simple one-page site for one-stop shopping for scenery, sector files, links to aircraft, items as listed 3.1.3.8. and anything else you'd like.

Data collectors should be informed of changes to exercise events.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Post-Exercise Analysis Phase. The post-exercise analysis phase includes postexercise AAR and evaluation actions. It focuses on the exercise objectives, documents exercise results, and provides feedback to exercise players and others. The exercise analysis may range in scope from a simple AAR to a comprehensive detailed analysis report. Data is evaluated to determine accomplishment of the objectives. The goal is to determine whether or not exercise objectives have been met. If not, the analysis should identify and define deficiencies or shortcomings and provide suggestions for possible changes to existing plans, policies, procedures, and systems. If the objectives were met, the analysis should document those current plans, policies, procedures, and systems are adequate. It should also identify any successful work-arounds exercise players developed. Completing AARs and distributing exercise results are important final steps.</p> </li> <li> <p>Post-Exercise Reporting Phase.

The ATO is the document that designates all of the missions for the exercise. The hardest part of deciphering the ATO is finding your specific mission. The mission tasking includes all of the mission specifics. Essential items such as aircraft type, Mode 3 codes, refueling altitudes, off/on-loads and call sign are clearly stated in the text line of the tasking. Depicted in Attachment 5 are examples of ATO tasking format. As with anything, the format may not be consistent between exercises, but the example illustrates the basic format.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Developing the mission for the Air Tasking Order (ATO).</p> <ol> <li> <p>Determine the mission that is to be conducted (i.e. Airdrop, SEAD, STRIKE, SAR, etc) and any support mission that might be required (i.e. Escort, SEAD, AR, etc). Mission types can be found in Attachment 2.</p> </li> <li> <p>Next determine the type and number of aircraft required.</p> </li> <li> <p>Now determine the flow of the mission. Typically for a Red Flag type of mission, the AWACS and tankers depart first to the area which is typically in a no-threat area. Next the bombers and fighters depart to their assigned pre-push holding areas which are behind the Marshall Limit Line (MLL). Remember to use standard departure routing to the areas, entry points and to deconflict altitudes and times crossing these points.</p> </li> <li> <p>Once the players begin to show-up at the hold areas, a mission push time will need to be established for each mission. Some items to consider for example are, if you have a STRIKE package going to a target that has ground-to-air threats (i.e., AAA, SAMs), you'd push your SEAD package first to eliminate that threat. Likewise, if there is an air-to-air threat, you'd want to send an ESCORT with the SEAD package and with the STRIKE package to counter this threat.</p> </li> <li> <p>Once the mission is pushed and complete, determine if the aircraft needs to stay on-station for another mission or if the aircraft can return to base (RTB). Depending on the fuel state of the aircraft, they should be tasked to refuel especially if conducting a second mission. For refueling planning requirements, see Attachment 3. If aircraft is not RTB, post refueling send aircraft back to a holding area.</p> </li> <li> <p>Establish push time for second missions and follow the guidance for the first mission.</p> </li> <li> <p>Once aircraft are RTB, be sure to use the SUA exit points and return published departures and to again deconflict altitudes and times.</p> </li> </ol> </li> </ol> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"org/10-204/chapter7/","title":"Chapter 7 -- Flow Card","text":"<ol> <li> <p>The Flow Card. The mission flow card is a quick reference tool used by the crews and AWACS/GCI controllers. The card typically has mission data for all tasked flights, authentication table, code-words, frequency table and communications flow. This card should be filled out by the overall mission commander using the ATO and SPINS, but typically the exercise planner fills in the card. When the card is filled out, it should depict the takeoff flow and deconflict all entry and exit points. This is useful for GCI/AWACS controllers and also if there are no controllers online. An example of the card is located in Attachment 7 and can be downloaded from the vUSAF Resource Center.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Mission Data. In the mission block, extract from the ATO the Callsign, Aircraft Type, Squawk Code, ARCT, Hold Point, Hold Altitude, Push Time, and Targets.

The SPINS will define the point at which to proceed \"tactical.\" At this point, cancel IFR with ATC and check in with the appropriate controlling agency at the designated point (usually defined in the SPINS). In addition, change your mode 3 to the designated values (fragged against your mission in the ATO). The frequency for check in is designated by controlling agency in the SPINS. An example of an initial check in could be: \"BLACKJACK, PAWN21 checks point tango, angels base plus 150, request picture north.\" A typical response would be \"PAWN21, BLACKJACK has you Sweet Sweet, picture north clear. You are cleared highway, fragged angels.\" Most communications will use a combination of these brevity words and designated code words. Code words are defined in the SPINS and usually change on a weekly basis. These words are words that convey specific meaning other than the obvious.

This guidance will describe in detail the component structures and their respective positions and duty descriptions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Organizational entities: The Virtual United States Air Force (vUSAF) is comprised of establishments, units and non-units.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Establishment: An organizational entity consisting of a headquarters unit and its subordinate units. The name of the establishment is in the name of the headquarters units. For example, Air Mobility Command (AMC) is an establishment; HQ AMC is its headquarters. Subordinate units are assigned to the establishment and not its headquarters unit.</p> <ol> <li> <p>A group with subordinate squadrons is generally the lowest-level establishment. Lower-level establishments are assigned to higher-level ones; for example, Groups to Wings, Wings to NAFs, MAFs to MAJCOMs, MAJCOMs to HQ vUSAF. This arrangement (units reporting to establishments, subordinate units' establishments to superior ones) sets up the Chain of Command (CoC) through which, all accountability and control flow.</p> </li> <li> <p>Establishments facilitate organizational actions. For example, the reassignment of a wing (establishment) from one NAF to another automatically reassigns the wing's subordinate units.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Unit: A military organization constituted by directives issued by HQ vUSAF. A unit is either named or numbered.</p> <ol> <li> <p>A unit helps provide for an unbroken chain of command (CoC) since military personnel must be assigned to a unit at all times. Each unit having military members must have an officer designated as its commander.</p> </li> <li> <p>Terms that apply to a unit:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Active unit: A major command (MAJCOM) constituted and activated by HQ vUSAF; or a subordinate unit constituted by HQ vUSAF, assigned to a MAJCOM, and activated by special order.</p> </li> <li> <p>Inactive unit: A unit constituted by HQ vUSAF but not yet activated or a unit constituted, activated and subsequently, inactivated.</p> </li> <li> <p>Disbanded unit: A unit whose legal authority for existence has been withdrawn by HQ vUSAF. Its designation is retired and preserved in historical records.</p> </li> <li> <p>Parent unit: An organization that directly administers units, detachments, or operating locations assigned to it.</p> </li> <li> <p>Provisional unit: A temporary unit organized to perform a specific task.</p> </li> <li> <p>Attached unit: A unit, or part of a unit, placed under the control of another organization for the specific purpose such as operational control, administrative control, or logistical support. It is the assigned to the parent unit.</p> </li> <li> <p>Detached unit: A unit serving away from its organization of assignment. It may function independently or may be attached to another organization.</p> </li> <li> <p>Primary subordinate unit: A unit that performs part or the entire primary mission of the organization to which it is assigned. The unit reports to the commander of the parent organization and has full authority to execute its assigned mission.</p> </li> </ol> </li> </ol> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>vUSAF organization: The organization of the vUSAF does not fully duplicate the real structure of the United States Air Force since the vUSAF is a virtual, hobby orientated organization using flight simulators and the internet, thus some areas of the actual United States Air Force are not needed or have no practical function in the virtual world. It shall be noted that the vUSAF shall be operated as closely as possible to that of the actual United State Air Force in its peacetime role. With a high regard for prototypical operation thereof.

This should be considered as a general reference for your conduct with this organization; however, it does not supersede any other directives or instructions.</p> <p>Background: The Virtual United States Air Force (vUSAF) was founded in 1999 as the primary force component of the United Nations Air Forces (UNAF), which in 2002 evolved into the Virtual Air Traffic Simulation Network (VATSIM) Special Operations Administration (VSOA). Under the VATSIM Special Operations Administration, each service department (or affiliate branch) is tasked with providing a replication of its real-world entity in order to provide the VATSIM and virtual aviation community with an avenue to experience and enjoy the challenges of military aviation. In the effort to recreate the United States Air Force, the VUSAF offer its members a realistic operation including airfield location, airframes, training, rank, policy and procedures. Above all the VUSAF strives to meet its core values of Enjoyment, Education and Excellence for its members. Achieving this mission, the VUSAF fulfills its goal of providing a highly motivated and well-trained branch over operational efficiency and realism to the entire body of affiliates of the VATSIM Special Operations Administration.</p> <p>As a VATSIM VSOA all members must use their real first and last name when applying for membership and must have a valid VATSIM ID Number. Failure to use your real first and last name when applying for VATSIM or vUSAF membership and/or failing to have a valid VATSIM ID Number will be cause for immediate dismissal from the vUSAF.</p> <ol> <li> <p>General Operating Rules of the vUSAF. We are all not fond of rules, but we need to have some, that is what makes us a unique virtual organization. We are modeled after the military so please understand there is a reason for the following.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Initial Training Requirements: All applicants will be required to participate in the Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT) program, before being assigned a duty station and aircraft. This is a must due to our affiliation with the VATSIM, Special Operations Administration (VSOA). The very nature of our aircraft and missions, require us to ensure that each member is capable of performing adequately. Therefore, we have instituted a flight-training program that all flying members must participate in. For advanced pilots, an abbreviated syllabus is in place to give a quick overview of aircraft and capabilities.</p> </li> <li> <p>Flying Requirements:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Active Duty:</p> <ol> <li> <p>All active duty vUSAF members are required to fly a minimum of two (2) flights a month on VATSIM (at least one hour per flight). Any pilot who fails to maintain that status will be notified via their chain of command. If the pilot does not post a Pilot's Report (PIREP) within ten days of the notice indicating that they have not flown the two required flights, they will be sent to the Inactive reserves for a period of 30 days and if not heard from in that time period will be administratively separated. There is no restriction as to the number of flights per month.</p> </li> <li> <p>In addition, pilots are expected to participate in all VUSAF sponsored events and deployments. Flights that are flown in the event count towards your monthly participation.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>All Pilots: All pilots will be required to maintain mission qualification status in the primary aircraft assigned. All pilots must refer to, and comply with, the requirements of vAFI 11-202 as they relate to the currency requirements for their primary aircraft.</p> </li> <li> <p>Other Considerations: It is also understood that this is a simulated organization and that sometimes pilots may not be able to fly the required flights in the time limit. Should this situation arise, pilots should submit a Leave of Absence (LOA) request via their chain of command. The request officially documents inactivity, therefore not being sent to the non-active reserves. Along with the request, pilots should, if possible, state the reason for the request and give an approximate date of return to active flying status.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Assigned and Additional Flights: All members will be assigned a flight from their respective commanders. If a member would like an additional flight over the required flights, he/she may accomplish such without being assigned and indicate to the commander via e-mail (if a blanket policy is in effect with the Wing Commander or higher) that they are conducting such flight and then by marking the applicable box on the MISsion REPort (MISREP).</p> <ol> <li>Periodically there will be a list of approved missions available on the VUSAF website. Pilots are not required to receive approval to perform these published missions as long as they remain within the published mission profile.</li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>MISREPS: All members are required to file a mission report at the completion of their assignments, to include mission assignment numbers on all weekly missions. The information from these reports are compiled and posted to the appropriate 201 files and commands on a weekly basis if not more. Therefore, it is required that all mission reports to be filed as soon as practical after a mission to ensure expedient and concise recording of completed missions and proper credit.</p> </li> <li> <p>Leave-of-Absence (LOA): Members who require a leave of absence may make such a request from their COC for whatever reason, below the following levels may grant the specified amount of leave:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Squadron Commander: Up to 2 weeks.</p> </li> <li> <p>Wing Commander: Up to 1 month.</p> </li> <li> <p>NAF Commander: Up to 2 months.</p> </li> <li> <p>MAJCOM Commander: Up to 3 months.</p> </li> <li> <p>For leave for longer periods of time a letter of explanation must be generated and sent through the CoC to AF/A3 and vCoS for consideration. The officer approving the Leave of Absence shall enter the LOA for the member.</p> </li> <li> <p>Members who are placed on a LOA greater than six (6) months will be placed into the inactive reserves. All members placed on extended leave of absence shall be required to comply with requirements established in vAFI 11-202 in regards to mission readiness.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>VUSAF Chief of Staff -- Rights:</p> <ol> <li> <p>The Chief of Staff may assign any member to any position, rank, aircraft, and station, at any time, as necessary to ensure the smooth operation of the vUSAF organization as a whole.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Chief of Staff may counsel, reprimand, suspend, and discharge any member of the vUSAF in accordance to prescribed means as outlined in vUSAF policy for violation(s) of FAA or like policy, VATSIM or similar network regulations, vUSAF policy and any act considered to be immoral or conduct unbecoming of a vUSAF member.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Vice Chief of Staff may assume the duties of the CoS in their absence or at the direction there of.</p> <ol> <li> <p>The Vice Chief of Staff rights and responsibilities:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Ensure all Air Staff and Commanders are properly exercising their duties</p> </li> <li> <p>Ensure compliance with all Virtual Air Force Instructions</p> </li> <li> <p>Ensure the promotional and OPR schedules are maintained</p> </li> <li> <p>Review vUSAF operations and recommend procedures that will allow the club to most closely simulate the real USAF.</p> </li> <li> <p>Review and recommend technology to improve operations</p> </li> </ol> </li> </ol> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Discipline: The escalating levels of managing discipline issues and incidents, based upon the severity of the violation or infraction are as follows:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Informal Warning - Delivered either verbally or via e-mail;</p> </li> <li> <p>Written Counseling -- Annotation in member's 201 file of a violation (made within the Staff Commenting section) that shall remain on file for 90 days;</p> </li> <li> <p>Written Reprimand - Annotation in member's 201 file of a violation (made within the Staff Commenting section) that shall remain on file for 180 days;</p> </li> <li> <p>Demotion/Reassignment -- Violator may be reduced in rank and or reassigned to another duty / position;</p> </li> <li> <p>Discharge -- Member may be discharged from service with the vUSAF.

This guidance will address the following areas:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Establish criteria and timetable for regular promotion of vUSAF personnel.</p> </li> <li> <p>Establish performance review reports of vUSAF personnel (OPR Reports).</p> </li> <li> <p>Establish formal application, interview and review process of VUSAF personnel in regards to promotions and filling of vacancies.</p> </li> <li> <p>Establish written directive concerning the advertisement of vacancies.</p> </li> <li> <p>Establish rank requirements &amp; limitations for vUSAF staff positions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Establishes policy for separation from the vUSAF and the return of prior members.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Regular Promotions of VUSAF Personnel: This section addresses regular promotion of eligible vUSAF personnel by establishing criteria and timetables for promotion for personnel wishing to advance in rank and / or position. The Director of Personnel/A1 will generate a list of pilots eligible to go up for promotion two (2) weeks prior to the opening of the testing period in January or July. This list will be posted in NOTAMS in vUSAF Discord.</p> <p>Once the list is posted all Commanders in that pilot's Chain of Command, (Squadron/CC to Wing/CC to NAF/CC to MAJCOM/CC to A3) shall score the pilot's performance between 1 and 5, with 5 being the highest, and forward this to the Director of Personnel/A1 at your earliest convenience.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Promotional Criteria Established: Effective the date of enactment of this document, all personnel shall be eligible for rank promotion if they have met all of the following criteria:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Remain active as defined in 36-100 section 1.2 FLYING REQUIREMENTS</p> </li> <li> <p>Must have a minimum of 50 flight hours to be eligible for vCaptain, 100 hours for vMajor, 150 hours for vLtColonel and 200 hours for vColonel.</p> </li> <li> <p>Have not been the subject of disciplinary action within 90-days of the established testing period.</p> </li> <li> <p>Receive a minimum score of 21 on your Officer Performance Reports for the quarter prior to examination.</p> </li> <li> <p>Served the minimum time in grade for each rank: vCaptain - 3 months; vMajor - 4 months; vLtColonel - 5 months; and vColonel - six months.</p> </li> <li> <p>If vCaptain or above be appropriately serving as an Instructor Pilot in their assigned unit.</p> </li> <li> <p>For promotion to vLtColonel or vColonel must be currently serving as a squadron or wing commander or not eligible.</p> </li> <li> <p>Complete the appropriate written examination for the rank for which you are testing for and pass said exam with a 70% or higher score. Exams are generated by Air Staff personnel and managed by vAFPC / vAETC.</p> </li> <li> <p>Once all of the above criterion is met the Officer will be scored on a merit matrix and only those in the top 80% will be promoted. The matrix competitive scores are within the same rank -- vCaptain vs vCaptain etc.</p> </li> <li> <p>The matrix will be scored by the vUSAF Director of Personnel/A1.</p> <p>How the matrix works. It scores each pilot candidate in five (5) areas: 1) It awards points for every point above an OPR score of 21, 2) it awards one point for each flight hour flown in the six months prior to the test month, 3) it awards one point for each month the pilot has been a member of the vUSAF, 4) it averages the score (from 1-5 points) awarded by each Officer in the pilot candidates Chain of Command up to the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations/A3, 5) it considers a passing exam score. It then generates a Candidate Selection Index score and if the pilot is in the 80th percentile they are promoted (21% to 100%).</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Promotion Schedule established: Promotional examinations shall be offered semi- annually. Members seeking promotion and have met the requirements will take the exam in the months of January and July.</p> </li> <li> <p>Rank and Positions established: The following are the available ranks within the Virtual United States Air Force (VUSAF) and their associated requirements listed lowest to highest:</p> Rank Minimum Longevity Minimum Requirements Specific Recruit N/A N/A O-1 2nd vLieutenant Complete IFT Complete IFT O-2 1st vLieutenant Complete AETC   Primary Training Complete AETC   Primary Training O-3 vCaptain 3 Months Service   as O-2 Complete AETC   Primary Training &amp; O-3 Promotional Exam Squadron / CC O-4 vMajor 4 Months Service   as O-3 Complete O-4   Promotional Exam Line Officer /   Flight Leader     Squadron / Wing O-5 vLt.

This section shall list the various categories of discharges and their associated penalties / benefits. Current members in good standing are welcome and encouraged to return to the vUSAF at any time when their respective situation and desires permit However, it is also the experience of the vUSAF senior staff to recognize a minority of the virtual community that leave and return with rapid frequency with, if at all, minimal justification. Therefore, one of the goals of this section is to encourage current members to remain active and utilize Leave of Absence (LOA) requests (see vAFI 36-100 section 1.6) rather than simply go inactive or resign. Prior to removing a member from the vUSAF the CoS or A3 will be required to perform an exit interview.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Honorable Discharge -- Member separated from the vUSAF or their specific billet in good standing and is subject to immediate reinstatement with minimal training requirements in accordance to all VUSAF policies</p> </li> <li> <p>General Discharge -- Member separated from the vUSAF or their specific billet under one or more of the following circumstances:</p> <ol> <li> <p>By request without viable justification.</p> </li> <li> <p>Due to inactivity / unresponsiveness to their appropriate CoC.</p> </li> <li> <p>Request Separation from the VUSAF within the first three months of being reinstated without viable justification.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Dishonorable Discharge -- member is separated from the vUSAF or their specific billet for one or more of the following circumstances:</p> <ol> <li> <p>As disciplinary action for violation of vUSAF policy.</p> </li> <li> <p>Due to inactivity / unresponsiveness to their CoC for 2 or more times in a year.</p> </li> <li> <p>Request Separation from the vUSAF within the first six months of being reinstated for 2 or more times without viable justification.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Return to Service: Members who have separated and have received an Honorable Discharge are permitted to return to service within the vUSAF.

The VUSAF has tried to create a system that will instill the same sense of accomplishment with respect to our real-world counterparts. Your objective should be to achieve the highest possible rank commensurate with your abilities. Realize that the vUSAF cannot promote everyone into the high-ranking positions, and the competition for those higher positions becomes more intense as you progress. This fair and equitable promotion system exists to achieve all of the goals of the vUSAF organization.</p> </li> </ol> <p>You should understand it, so that you can better appreciate the significance of your successes and better realize the necessary competitiveness of the vUSAF promotions. The vUSAF officer promotion program has served the individual officers and the vUSAF well by continually producing highly qualified and mission ready personnel.</p> <p>// Signed //</p> <p>Chief of Staff</p> <ol> <li> <p>O-5: Must have helped in planning or moderation of event to include unit level exercises.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>O-6: Must have helped in planning or commanding of a vUSAF or VSOA sponsored event\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"pers/36-104/info/","title":"vAFI 36-104 vUSAF Personnel Transfer Policy","text":"<p>COMPLIANCE WITH THIS INSTRUCTION IS MANDATORY</p> <p>Revision Info</p> <ul> <li>Document Number: vAFI 36-104</li> <li>Date: 25 May 2020</li> <li>OPR: vUSAF/CS</li> <li>Supersedes: 10 Feb 2006, 17 Aug 2008, 07 Feb 2014, 12 Jun 2018, 30 Apr 2020</li> <li>Certified by: Chief of Staff</li> </ul> <p>PURPOSE: To outline the process by which members of the vUSAF may request transfer between units, MAJCOM's and Simulation Platforms.</p> <p>Request for Transfer Process:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Intra-MAJCOM Transfer</p> <ol> <li> <p>Any member desiring transfer to another unit within the same MAJCOM is required to discuss their transfer with their Commanding Officer.
